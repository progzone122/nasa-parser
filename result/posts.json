If there is a way to get something done, the folks at NASA Stennis will discover it.\nASTRA is no different and represents a first in this particular space (pun intended!) of autonomous systems work at NASA Stennis.\nThis is a first step toward fulfilling part of the center’s strategic plan to design autonomous systems to help accelerate the development of intelligent aerospace systems and services for government and industry.\nSuch work could contribute to enhanced efficiency, improved safety, scalability to meet demands, and much more. The potential is ASTRA-nomical. See what I did there?\nPotential is not developed over night, which makes ASTRA even more intriguing. The mission could run for up to four years while gathering valuable data along the way.\nThe ASTRA mission is an exciting leap forward for NASA Stennis to learn what is possible and perhaps open doors for a future that unlocks new frontiers.\nOne thing this Gator has learned to be true is the brighter the future, the more we must believe in ourselves, and I believe in the NASA Stennis Autonomous Systems Laboratory team.\n> Back to Top\nNASA Stennis Top News\nNASA Stennis Set to Continue ASTRA Mission with Sidus Space\nNASA’s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, announced Wednesday it will continue its historic in-space autonomous systems payload mission aboard an orbiting satellite through a follow-on agreement with Sidus Space, Inc.\n\n\t\n\t\tRead More About the ASTRA Mission\n\t\t\n\t\nNASA Stennis Completes Key Test Complex Water System Upgrade\nFor almost 60 years, NASA’s Stennis Space Center has tested rocket systems and engines to help power the nation’s human space exploration dreams.

An image from Oct. 11, 1984, shows astronaut Kathryn D. Sullivan checking the latch of an antenna in the space shuttle Challenger’s open cargo during her historic extravehicular activity (spacewalk). The 13th flight of the Space Shuttle Program, STS-41G, was the first flight to include two women, Sullivan and Sally Ride. Ride has become the first American woman to fly to space in June 1983. A little more than a year later, Sullivan became the first American woman to walk in space. NASA’s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, tested space shuttle main engines for 34 years, from 1975 to 2009. The testing included hot fires of the flight engines that helped power this historic moment. To honor this time in space history, watch Space for Women on the agency’s new streaming platform – NASA+. The film features interviews with NASA employees and shows the variety of positions held by women in the agency.NASA\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe official portrait of Astronaut Kathryn D.

Following conversations with Mississippi and Louisiana congressional representatives and staffers, Bailey and Powell attended the Hidden Figures Congressional Gold Medal ceremony. The awards recognized the women who contributed to the U.S. space race, including the NASA mathematicians who helped land the first astronauts on the Moon under the agency’s Apollo Program. NASA Stennis, established in the 1960s, tested first and second stages of the Saturn V rocket for Apollo missions to the Moon. The south Mississippi NASA center continues supporting the NASA mission by testing engines and stages to help power the agency’s Artemis campaign to return astronauts to the Moon and beyond. </div><div class=\"hds-credits\">NASA</div></figcaption></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"display-block width-full\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"margin-0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hds-cover-wrapper hds-image-carousel-slide margin-bottom-2\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hds-media-wrapper margin-left-auto margin-right-auto\"><figure class=\"hds-media-inner hds-cover-wrapper hds-media-ratio-cover \"><img srcset=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/capitol-hill-2.jpg 4032w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/capitol-hill-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/capitol-hill-2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/capitol-hill-2.jpg?resize=1024,768 1024w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/capitol-hill-2.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/capitol-hill-2.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/capitol-hill-2.jpg?resize=400,300 400w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/capitol-hill-2.jpg?resize=600,450 600w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/capitol-hill-2.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/capitol-hill-2.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/capitol-hill-2.jpg?resize=2000,1500 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" alt=\"NASA Stennis Deputy Director Christine Powell, left, and NASA Stennis Director John Bailey, right, are standing with U.S. Rep.

An image from Oct. 11, 1984, shows astronaut Kathryn D. Sullivan checking the latch of an antenna in the space shuttle Challenger’s open cargo during her historic extravehicular activity (spacewalk). The 13th flight of the Space Shuttle Program, STS-41G, was the first flight to include two women, Sullivan and Sally Ride. Ride has become the first American woman to fly to space in June 1983. A little more than a year later, Sullivan became the first American woman to walk in space. NASA’s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, tested space shuttle main engines for 34 years, from 1975 to 2009. The testing included hot fires of the flight engines that helped power this historic moment. To honor this time in space history, watch Space for Women on the agency’s new streaming platform – NASA+. The film features interviews with NASA employees and shows the variety of positions held by women in the agency.</div><div class=\"hds-credits\">NASA</div></figcaption></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"display-block width-full\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"margin-0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hds-cover-wrapper hds-image-carousel-slide margin-bottom-2\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hds-media-wrapper margin-left-auto margin-right-auto\"><figure class=\"hds-media-inner hds-cover-wrapper hds-media-ratio-cover \"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-2-kathryn-sullivan.jpg?w=819\" srcset=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-2-kathryn-sullivan.jpg 3300w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-2-kathryn-sullivan.jpg?resize=240,300 240w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-2-kathryn-sullivan.jpg?resize=768,960 768w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-2-kathryn-sullivan.jpg?resize=819,1024 819w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-2-kathryn-sullivan.jpg?resize=1229,1536 1229w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-2-kathryn-sullivan.jpg?resize=1638,2048 1638w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-2-kathryn-sullivan.jpg?resize=320,400 320w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-2-kathryn-sullivan.jpg?resize=480,600 480w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-2-kathryn-sullivan.jpg?resize=720,900 720w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-2-kathryn-sullivan.jpg?resize=960,1200 960w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-2-kathryn-sullivan.jpg?resize=1600,2000 1600w\" block_context=\"nasa-block\" height=\"1024\" style=\"transform: scale(1.02); transform-origin: 47% 19%; object-position: 47% 19%; object-fit: cover;\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" alt=\"Kathryn Sullivan stands for a portrait wearing a light blue NASA jumpsuit.\" width=\"819\"></figure><figcaption class=\"hds-caption padding-y-2\"><div class=\"hds-caption-text p-sm margin-0\">The official portrait of Astronaut Kathryn D.

The DSOC experiment consists of an uplink and downlink station, plus a flight laser transceiver flying with Psyche.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\n\n\n\nThe Deep Space Optical Communications tech demo has completed several key milestones, culminating in sending a signal to Mars’ farthest distance from Earth.\nNASA’s Deep Space Optical Communications technology demonstration broke yet another record for laser communications this summer by sending a laser signal from Earth to NASA’s Psyche spacecraft about 290 million miles (460 million kilometers) away. That’s the same distance between our planet and Mars when the two planets are farthest apart.\nSoon after reaching that milestone on July 29, the technology demonstration concluded the first phase of its operations since launching aboard Psyche on Oct. 13, 2023.\n“The milestone is significant. Laser communication requires a very high level of precision, and before we launched with Psyche, we didn’t know how much performance degradation we would see at our farthest distances,” said Meera Srinivasan, the project’s operations lead at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “Now the techniques we use to track and point have been verified, confirming that optical communications can be a robust and transformative way to explore the solar system.”\nManaged by JPL, the Deep Space Optical Communications experiment consists of a flight laser transceiver and two ground stations. Caltech’s historic 200-inch (5-meter) aperture Hale Telescope at Caltech’s Palomar Observatory in San Diego County, California, acts as the downlink station to which the laser transceiver sends its data from deep space. The Optical Communications Telescope Laboratory at JPL’s Table Mountain facility near Wrightwood, California, acts as the uplink station, capable of transmitting 7 kilowatts of laser power to send data to the transceiver.\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization shows Psyche’s position on July 29 when the uplink station for NASA’s Deep Space Optical Communications sent a laser signal about 290 million miles to the spacecraft. See an interactive version of the Psyche spacecraft in NASA’s Eyes on the Solar System.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\n\n\n\nBy transporting data at rates up to 100 times higher than radio frequencies, lasers can enable the transmission of complex scientific information as well as high-definition imagery and video, which are needed to support humanity’s next giant leap when astronauts travel to Mars and beyond.\nAs for the spacecraft, Psyche remains healthy and stable, using ion propulsion to accelerate toward a metal-rich asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.\nExceeding Goals\nThe technology demonstration’s data is sent to and from Psyche as bits encoded in near-infrared light, which has a higher frequency than radio waves. That higher frequency enables more data to be packed into a transmission, allowing far higher rates of data transfer.\nEven when Psyche was about 33 million miles (53 million kilometers) away — comparable to Mars’ closest approach to Earth — the technology demonstration could transmit data at the system’s maximum rate of 267 megabits per second. That bit rate is similar to broadband internet download speeds. As the spacecraft travels farther away, the rate at which it can send and receive data is reduced, as expected.\nOn June 24, when Psyche was about 240 million miles (390 million kilometers) from Earth — more than 2½ times the distance between our planet and the Sun — the project achieved a sustained downlink data rate of 6.25 megabits per second, with a maximum rate of 8.3 megabits per second. While this rate is significantly lower than the experiment’s maximum, it is far higher than what a radio frequency communications system using comparable power can achieve over that distance.\nThis Is a Test\nThe goal of Deep Space Optical Communications is to demonstrate technology that can reliably transmit data at higher speeds than other space communication technologies like radio frequency systems. In seeking to achieve this goal, the project had an opportunity to test unique data sets like art and high-definition video along with engineering data from the Psyche spacecraft. For example, one downlink included digital versions of Arizona State University’s “Psyche Inspired” artwork, images of the team’s pets, and a 45-second ultra-high-definition video that spoofs television test patterns from the previous century and depicts scenes from Earth and space.\n\n\n\nThis 45-second ultra-high-definition video was streamed via laser from deep space by NASA’s Deep Space Optical Communications technology demonstration on June 24, when the Psyche spacecraft was 240 million miles from Earth. NASA/JPL-Caltech\nThe technology demonstration beamed the first ultra-high-definition video from space, featuring a cat named Taters, from the Psyche spacecraft to Earth on Dec. 11, 2023, from 19 million miles away. (Artwork, images, and videos were uploaded to Psyche and stored in its memory before launch.)\n“A key goal for the system was to prove that the data-rate reduction was proportional to the inverse square of distance,” said Abi Biswas, the technology demonstration’s project technologist at JPL. “We met that goal and transferred huge quantities of test data to and from the Psyche spacecraft via laser.” Almost 11 terabits of data have been downlinked during the first phase of the demo.\nThe flight transceiver is powered down and will be powered back up on Nov. 4. That activity will prove that the flight hardware can operate for at least a year.\n“We’ll power on the flight laser transceiver and do a short checkout of its functionality,” said Ken Andrews, project flight operations lead at JPL. “Once that’s achieved, we can look forward to operating the transceiver at its full design capabilities during our post-conjunction phase that starts later in the year.”\nMore About Deep Space Optical Communications\nThis demonstration is the latest in a series of optical communication experiments funded by the Space Technology Mission Directorate’s Technology Demonstration Missions Program managed at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and the agency’s SCaN (Space Communications and Navigation) program within the Space Operations Mission Directorate. Development of the flight laser transceiver is supported by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, L3 Harris, CACI, First Mode, and Controlled Dynamics Inc. Fibertek, Coherent, Caltech Optical Observatories, and Dotfast support the ground systems. Some of the technology was developed through NASA’s Small Business Innovation Research program.\nFor more information about the laser communications demo, visit:\nhttps://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/deep-space-optical-communications-dsoc\n\n\t\n\t\tNASA’s Optical Comms Demo Transmits Data Over 140 Million Miles\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThe NASA Cat Video Explained\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t5 Things to Know About NASA’s Deep Space Optical Communications\n\t\t\n\t\nNews Media Contacts\nIan J.

On that day, the GPM mission, a joint Earth-observing mission between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), began its journey to provide the world with an unprecedented picture of global precipitation (i.e., rain and snow). GPM continues to observe important precipitation characteristics and gain physical insights into precipitation processes using an advanced radar and passive microwave (PMW) radiometer on the GPM–CO along with leveraging a constellation of satellites. (The Earth Observer reported on the GPM–CO launch and plans for the mission in its November–December 2013 issue – see GPM Core Observatory: Advancing Precipitation Instruments and Expanding Coverage.) As GPM is now well into its 10th year in orbit, the time is fitting to reflect on and celebrate what this mission has accomplished and showcase its contributions to science and society. While occasionally dealing with equipment malfunction, the GPM–CO has operated nearly continuously over its lifetime and recently was put into a higher orbit to conserve station-keeping fuel. As a result, GPM remains in extended operations and continues its observations after 10 years, making significant advances in the precipitation field through improving sensor calibration, retrieval algorithms, and ground validation measurements. GPM data continues to further our understanding of the characteristics of liquid and frozen precipitation around the world and improving our scientific knowledge of Earth's water and energy cycles. These advances have extended to numerous societal benefits related to operational weather prediction, situational awareness and prediction of extreme events, hydrological and climate model development, water resource and crop management activities, and public health alerts. Additionally, this information has informed the K–12 and post-secondary audiences, influencing the next generation of scientists. More information is available at NASA’s GPM website.Advancing Precipitation Measurements: The Need for the GPM MissionPrecipitation is a vital component of global water and energy cycles and crucially impactful to life on Earth. The distribution, frequency, and extremes in precipitation affect everything from agriculture to the insurance industry, to travel and your weekend plans. Prior to the meteorological satellite era, precipitation observations were limited to populated areas leaving wide swaths of land and almost the entirety of the oceans (70% of Earth’s surface) unobserved. GPM builds on decades of advances in satellite precipitation observations.Early precipitation observations from space (e.g., from the Nimbus series) used visible and infrared measurements that gave the first, approximate estimates. PMW radiometers, however, gave a next generation of more direct and improved precipitation measurement. The NASA–JAXA Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), launched in November 1997, significantly advanced the field with the addition of a Precipitation Radar (PR) alongside a wider-swath PMW radiometer. This was groundbreaking for precipitation research and advancement of measurement techniques, but was limited to the tropics and a single satellite in low Earth orbit. To move toward the goal of a globally distributed, high-frequency, physically consistent satellite precipitation product a new mission design was conceived in GPM.The GPM Mission: Science Requirements, Objectives, and InstrumentsThe GPM–CO spacecraft is an advanced successor to the TRMM spacecraft, providing additional channels on both the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) to enhance capabilities to sense light rain and falling snow. The GPM–CO, another NASA–JAXA partnership, operates in an inclined, non-Sun synchronous orbit that allows the spacecraft to sample precipitation across all hours of the day, as did TRMM. However, TRMM only covered tropical and subtropical regions, while the GPM–CO also covers middle and sub-polar latitudes.The GPM mission has several key scientific objectives, including:advancing precipitation measurements from space;improving our knowledge of precipitation systems, water cycle variability, and freshwater availability;improving climate modeling and prediction;improving weather forecasting and four-dimensional [4D – i.e., three-dimensional (3D) spatial plus temporal] reanalysis; andimproving hydrological modeling and prediction.GPM Core Observatory InstrumentsThe GMI and DPR instruments together provide a powerful synergistic tool to assess precipitation structure, intensity, and phase globally at relatively high (regional) spatial resolutions. The DPR’s Ku-band (13.6 GHz) and Ka-band (35.5 GHz) channels provide 3D retrievals of precipitation structure with a vertical resolution of 250 m (~820 ft) and a horizontal resolution of ~5 km (~3 mi) across a swath up to 245 km (152 mi). The GMI is a 13-channel conically scanning PMW radiometer providing observations across a wide swath [885 km (~550 mi)] to estimate precipitation estimates at resolutions as fine as 5 km – see Figure 1.When scientists and engineers collaborated on the design of GMI, they knew it would need to meet exacting requirements so that its data could be used both to support development of precipitation retrieval algorithms and to provide a calibration standard for the partner sensors in the GPM constellation. The attention to detail has paid off. To this day, GMI is deemed to be one of the best calibrated conically scanning PMW radiometers in space.Together, these two well-calibrated GPM–CO instruments gather scientifically advanced observations of precipitation between 68°N and 68°S – which covers where the majority of the Earth’s population falls. This coverage allows opportunities to observe both surface precipitation rates and 3D precipitation structure and allows observations of diverse weather systems, including hurricanes and typhoons (e.g., from formation to their transition from the tropics to midlatitudes), severe convection, falling snow, light rain, and frontal systems over both land and ocean.Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the GPM Core Observatory's Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) instruments. Figure credit: GPM websiteGPM ConstellationWhile the GPM–CO is a key component of the GPM mission, another fundamental component is the constellation of national and international partner satellites known as the GPM Constellation, which has numbers ~10 at any given time – with the current members listed at the link referenced above. Each GPM Constellation partner designed and operated the satellites for their own particular missions, but they agreed to share the data from their missions to enable the next-generation of unified global precipitation estimates. The combination of these partner satellites and the GPM–CO allow frequent intersections of their orbits, permitting colocated and cotemporal observations to be made, which are crucial to ensure effective intercalibration.The GPM–CO serves as the “calibrator” to unify precipitation estimates across these different partners’ satellite sensors, ensuring that the observed microwave brightness temperatures (TB) are consistent among the sensors with expected differences after accounting for variations in the observing frequencies, bandwidths, polarizations, and view angles. The advanced calibration across the sensors is a remarkable achievement, and it allows the project to focus on the precipitation products rather than TB uncertainties. This careful calibration enables high-quality datasets that support and enable detailed investigations on the distribution of precipitation and how these patterns change over days, seasons, and years, enabling a breadth of science and societal applications at local and global scales.Ground Validation Activities: Significant Contributions to the GPM MissionAn integral part of a successful satellite mission is a robust and active ground validation (GV) program. During the TRMM era, the TRMM PR, and/or the TRMM PMW radiometer instruments limited GV to simple comparisons of rain rates to surface measurements from radars and/or rain gauges, which is referred to as statistical validation. It soon became obvious that a more robust GV program would be needed to better aid future satellite algorithm developers to improve the physics of their algorithms rather than just justifying tweaking their outputs. As a result, unlike TRMM, GPM’s GV program has been part of the mission concept from its inception. The GPM team developed a three-tiered approach that uses:  statistical validation, as done during TRMM; physical validation, where the emphasis is on better understanding of the physics and microphysics of different precipitating systems; and hydrological validation, which emphasizes improving precipitation retrievals over large-scale areas (e.g., watersheds).To address these goals, there have been several pre- and post-launch field campaigns conducted. In chronological order, these include the:Light Precipitation Evaluation Experiment (LPVEx), a prelaunch field campaign taking place in September and October 2010 over the Gulf of Finland;GPM Cold Season Precipitation Experiment (GCPEX) over and near the Ontario, Canada/Great Lakes Environment Canada Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments (CARE) from January 17 to February 29, 2012;Mid-Latitude Continental Convective Cloud Experiment (MC3E) in north–central Oklahoma, April 22 to June 6, 2012;Iowa Flood Studies (IFloodS)) in eastern Iowa, May 1 to June 15, 2013;Integrated Precipitation & Hydrology Experiment (IPHEx) from May 1 to June 15, 2014, in the mountains of central North Carolina; and Olympic Mountain Experiment (OLYMPEX), the last full-scale, postlaunch, and GPM-sponsored field campaign – and one of the most logistically challenging – conducted over the Olympic Peninsula and adjacent waters from November 1, 2015 to January 31, 2016.Each of these field campaigns were designed to provide insight into different precipitation regimes and types to improve GPM satellite observations. For example, MC3E allowed for comprehensive observations of intense convection over continental regions. The researchers deployed an extensive network of ground instruments (e.g., radars, disdrometers, rain gauges), in coordination with flights of NASA’s ER-2 and University of North Dakota’s Cessna Citation II research aircrafts, to sample varied precipitation types (e.g., severe thunderstorms, Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS)). Data from MC3E allowed for improvement of both active (DPR) and passive (GMI) retrievals over land. GCPEx has allowed for sampling of snowing systems. During this campaign, NASA’s ER-2 flew high above the clouds in coordination with NASA’s DC-3 aircraft flying within the clouds. Here again, GCPEx participants deployed a vast network of ground instruments (e.g., snow gauges, disdrometers). The goal for GCPEx was to formulate and validate frozen/mixed precipitation retrievals from the GPM satellite. (Note that from 2011–2015, The Earth Observer published articles on five of the six GV campaigns described in this section; the reader can locate these articles on The Earth Observer Archives Page. Scroll down to the “Bibliography of Articles with Historical Context Published in The Earth Observer” listicle and look for Field Campaigns.)While these large-scale campaigns were extremely beneficial for achieving GPM science objectives, the costs of deploying instruments and personnel in these remote regions can be substantial. In order to provide long-term measurements at reasonable costs, the GPM GV established the Precipitation Research Facility (PRF) at the Wallops Flight Facility (WFF). The goal of this facility was to provide long-term measurements from the myriad instruments that have been deployed at the various field campaigns and manage them with full-time GV personnel. The linchpin of the PRF is NASA’s S-band, Dual-Polarimetric Radar (NPOL) – see Photo 1. NPOL was deployed in a farm field about 38 km (~24 mi) northeast of WFF to provide areal estimates of surface precipitation as well as profiles of precipitating systems above other GV surface instruments (e.g., profiling radars, disdrometers, and rain gauges). To add to this effort, the PRF staff established a network of rain gauges and disdrometers, which are deployed over the eastern shore of Maryland. These data are telemetered so that an added benefit to this effort is that the GPM GV data provide valuable, near-real-time data to many of the numerous farmers on the Delmarva Peninsula. The PRF’s principal activity is to design new GV instruments, test new validation methods, and assess instrument uncertainties using the abundant infrastructure of the GPM GV validation program. This coordination between GPM GV instruments, WFF-based staff, and regional data collection, quality control, and analysis are the core components of the PRF.Photo 1.

The radar, when disassembled, fits within the five, white sea-containers located around the radar in this photo; it can be transported via 18-wheelers. In addition to IFloodS, NPOL has also been deployed for field campaigns in Oklahoma (MC3E), North Carolina (IPHEx), and Washington (OLYMPEX) – all of which are mentioned in the text above.Photo credit: David Wolff/WFFGPM Data ProductsGPM data products and services have played an important role in research, applications, and education. The Precipitation Processing System (PPS) housed at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) produces and distributes GPM products that are archived and distributed at the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) as well.GES DISC is one of a dozen discipline-oriented Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) that NASA operates for processing the terabytes of data returns from its satellites, aircraft, field campaigns, and other sources. (To learn more about Earth Science Data Operations, which includes the DAACs, see Earth Science Data Operations: Acquiring, Distributing, and Delivering NASA Data for the Benefit of Society. The Earth Observer, Mar–Apr 2017, 29:2, 4–18.  A chart listing all the DAACs appears on pp. 7–8 of this article.)In addition to precipitation estimates, users can access variables, such as calibrated TB, radar reflectivity, latent heating, and hydrometeor profiles in GPM products. See the Table 1 below for a listing of NASA GPM data products. Table 1.

One of the key mission requirements of the PPS was to ensure that processing and reprocessing always include data from the TRMM era (starting in December 1997). Algorithm development would ensure that the same algorithm would be used to process both TRMM- and GPM-era data collected from the TRMM and GPM spacecrafts and the GPM constellation. As a result, an important part of this cross-mission processing is the intercalibration of PMW radiometers using GMI. Using data from the overlap period of GMI and TMI, TMI is intercalibrated to GMI and is then used to intercalibrate the radiometer data during the TRMM era. This intercalibration manifests itself in the intercalibrated brightness temperatures (Tc) provided in the Level 1C (L1C) product for each radiometer. The GPM Profiling Algorithm (GPROF) retrieval uses these intercalibrated L1C products and guarantees consistent mission intercalibrated precipitation retrievals. For example, the L2 product stage that converts TB into precipitation estimates applies the same GPROF to the GPM constellation of PMW radiometers.Continued Improvement of GPM AlgorithmsOne important achievement of GPM is the continued improvements in GPM’s algorithms that produce the immense amount of precipitation data that are used by scientific researchers and stakeholders alike. GPM’s five algorithms – DPR-, GPROF-, Combined-, Convective-Stratiform Heating-, and Multisatellite – have all undergone version updates several times (e.g., Version 01–07), with additional updates planned for the next 1–4 years. Each update entails a tremendous amount of work behind the scenes from GPM’s algorithm developers to ensure that quality data are available to the public.Each new version provides a complete reprocessing of the entire data record using the improved retrieval algorithms, based on validation against reliable GV data, feedback from users, new understanding of the processes, and improved techniques. This not only helps ensure a consistent data record and fair comparisons against past events but also helps refine and improve the data to capture precipitation phenomena more exactly. Just as an original photograph capturing a past event can be reanalyzed with new technology, reprocessing revisits the observed satellite instruments’ “raw” radiances and refines the process of converting them to the end product of precipitation quantities.“We know more now about the global rain and snowfall in, say, 2010, than we did when it actually happened.” – George Huffman [GPM Project Scientist]This process is an inverse problem that helps determine the physical quantities (e.g., precipitation rate) given the observed signal (e.g., microwave radiance). For precipitation, this retrieval process relies on complex algorithms and is by no means straightforward. This is an underconstrained problem where different combinations of physical quantities can give the same observed signal, especially for passive instruments. Thus it requires additional information or assumptions.The aim of each version in GPM is to have \"better\" estimates of the precipitation variables than the previous version. However, what better means can involve trade-offs. An excellent example is a change implemented from V06 to V07 in one of GPM’s most widely-used products – the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) algorithm – which is NASA GPM’s multisatellite product that combines information from the GPM satellite constellation to estimate precipitation over the majority of the Earth's surface. The resulting IMERG products provide near-global precipitation data at a resolution of 10 km (~6mi), every 30 minutes covering latitudes of 60°N–60°S, and are available at different latencies (Early, Late, and Final, as defined in Table 1) to cater to a range of end-user communities for operational and research applications. IMERG is particularly valuable over areas of Earth's surface that lack ground-based, precipitation-measuring instruments, including oceans and remote areas. Specifically, this change to IMERG V07 resulted in improvements towards the distribution of precipitation rates, allowing for a better representation of precipitation areas and extremes. However, it reduced correlation against ground reference data. Another example is the gauge adjustment process in IMERG that offers a substantial improvement at the expense of higher random error.The result of these intricate reprocessing cycles is a family of precipitation products that improves accuracy, a longer record, and expanding coverage, all while responding to feedback and requests from users. This is especially the case for downstream products like IMERG, which is widely used for science and applications due to its completeness and regularity, and inherits the improvements in each reprocessing cycle across the family.Meeting User NeedsThe number one requirement on PPS was to provide well-curated standard reference products with carefully curated provenience. For each data product version, a complete record is kept of spacecraft maneuvers and issues, data input issues, and data formats. This makes GPM data products a standard against which others can be compared and the standard products themselves improved.The GPM mission also requires near-real-time (NRT) products. As a research agency, NASA does not generally specify operational NRT requirements. Instead, these NRT products are usually provided on a “best effort” basis. During its core mission (the first three years), PPS did have NRT requirements. Since then, PPS continues to fulfill these as budget permits. The half-hourly 0.1 x 0.1º L3 global IMERG products are provided in NRT with latency objectives for the IMERG Early (Late) run of 4+ (14+) hours after data collection.To facilitate data interoperability and interdisciplinary science, the PPS and the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) have developed value-added data services and products since the TRMM era, including data subsetting (spatial and temporal), L3 data regridding, network common data form (NetCDF) format conversion, remote data access (e.g., via Open Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP), Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) Data Server [GDS]), NASA GIS translation of GPM data for various accumulation periods, GPM Applications Programming Interface (API), and data visualization tools. For example, the more technical Hierarchical Data Formats (HDF) mission IMERG products are reformatted and accumulated to GIS-friendly additions in Geographic Tagged Image File Format (geoTIFF) format for both Early and Late Run IMERG products at 30-min, 3-hour, and 1-day temporal resolution. Other value-added products include the daily products for IMERG Early, Late, and Final Runs from GES DISC. Quick visualization tools, such as the IMERG Global Viewer, are freely available to the public to access and view the latest NRT GPM IMERG global precipitation datasets at 30-minute, 1-day, and 7-day intervals, on an interactive 3D globe in a web browser. User services and tutorials (e.g., Frequently Asked Questions, How-Tos, help desk, user forum) are also available across the GPM, PPS, and GES DISC webpages.Along with the other DAACs, GES DISC is facilitating data access and use by migrating its products and services to NASA's Earthdata cloud. Once the migration is finished, users will be able to access all NASA’s Earth data products from the 12 DAACs in one place, which can simplify interdisciplinary science studies. Over 50% of the archived GES DISC products have been migrated to the cloud as of this writing. Users can either access them directly in the NASA Earthdata cloud environment or download data in their own computing environment. To broaden the GPM user community – especially for users who are either non-technical or not familiar with NASA data – GES DISC has developed an online interactive tool called Giovanni, for viewing, analyzing, and downloading multiple Earth science datasets (including GPM) from within a web browser, allowing users to circumvent downloading data and software. At present, GPM L3 precipitation products (IMERG) along with over 2000 interdisciplinary variables from other NASA missions or projects are available in Giovanni. Over 20 plot types are included in Giovanni to facilitate data exploration, product comparison, and research. Links to results and data can be shared with colleagues. Data in different formats (e.g., NetCDF, comma separated values, or CSV) can be downloaded as well. A list of referral papers utilizing Giovanni is available. Data services continue to evolve to meet increasing user requirements, such as the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) guiding principles, open science, data integration, interdisciplinary science, and data democratization.Science and Societal Application Highlights from 10 Years of Observing Precipitation with GPMAs scientists and stakeholder organizations have made use of GPM datasets for analysis and research over the past decade, myriad scientific discoveries have been made leading to the emergence of a wide variety of real-time and retrospective societal applications for GPM data. These GPM user communities continue to dig into scientific questions and provide time-critical decision support to the public. This portion of the article highlights several of the scientific and application achievements made possible since the mission launched in 2014. This list is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather demonstrates GPM’s unique accomplishments and what the mission offers for science and society.Capturing Microphysical Properties and Vertical Structure Information of Precipitating SystemsFigure 2. Seasonal average cloud latent heating at a height of 6 km (~4 mi) derived from GSFC’s Goddard Convective–Stratiform (Latent) Heating Algorithm (CSH) algorithm for the period December 2020–November 2023. Heating arises from cloud and precipitation processes making its spatial distribution highly correlated with precipitation. CSH shows deep, intense cloud heating in the tropics within the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), west Pacific Ocean, and tropical land masses. Broad areas of heating at higher latitudes are associated with midlatitude storm tracks. Seasonal shifts in heating are most prominent over land.Image credit: Steven Lang /GSFC/Science Systems and Applications, Inc. (SSAI)One of GPM’s main charges was to provide microphysical properties and vertical structure information of precipitating systems using passive and active remote sensing techniques. Measurements of the vertical structure of clouds are fundamentally important to improving our understanding of how they affect both local- and large-scale environments. Achieving this goal has required considerable enhancement of the NASA GPM algorithms – including the DPR, GPROF, Combined (CMB), and Convective–Stratiform (Latent) Heating (CSH) algorithms – from their original capabilities at the time of launch.The advanced instrumentation of GPM’s dual-frequency, Ku/Ka-band radar added new capabilities beyond the TRMM PR’s single Ku band. As a result, the DPR algorithms provide vertical hydrometeor profiles at the radar range bin level [~5 km (~3 mi) horizontal, 125 m (~410 ft) vertical]. Such detailed measurements are critical for classifying precipitation events (e.g., convective or stratiform) and characterizing the dominant types of precipitation particles, precipitation characteristics, and freezing level height. Additionally, these DPR algorithms have played a significant role in retrieving parameters of the particle size distribution (PSD) in rain. All of these factors help support and elucidate the understanding of storm systems and their impacts at local and regional scales.More recently falling snow microphysics have received increasing attention.  Characterizing snow remains a challenging problem for precipitation measuring/modeling due to varying particle habits, shapes, and snow mass densities. The higher frequencies added on both the DPR and GMI instruments have enabled improved observations of ice and snow, not only revealing new insights into the intensity and microphysical composition of cold-season precipitation but enabling an increased understanding of precipitation, clouds, and climate feedbacks. Another important parameter that is derived from GPM vertical profile information is latent heating (LH), which is so named because it measures the “hidden” energy when water changes phase but doesn’t impact its temperature. The vertical structure of LH is a key parameter for understanding the coupling of the Earth’s water and energy cycles. Although it cannot be directly observed, GPM-derived precipitation estimates, microphysical properties, and vertical structure provide critical information for inferring the vertical structure of LH –  see Figure 2. Researchers can access this information using the U.S. Science Team’s CSH datasets as well as the Japanese Science Team’s Spectral Latent Heating (LSH) datasets. GPM’s sampling of higher latitudes –  not available from TRMM ­–  has resulted in estimates of the intensity and variability of 3D LH structures of precipitation systems beyond the tropics. The CSH algorithm has advanced during the GPM era due to improvements in numerical cloud models and higher accuracy vertical precipitation structure profiles.Improve knowledge of Precipitation Systems, Water Cycle Variability, and Freshwater AvailabilityA key success of GPM –  both from information from the GPM–CO and from combining with the information from the constellation satellites – is the expansion of knowledge of precipitation systems both in the tropics and at middle and high latitudes. In addition, the program contributes to water availability and variations in time and space. The radar and PMW instruments on the GPM–CO lead to the most accurate surface precipitation rate estimates and vertical structure of the systems, allowing researchers to study key features of these systems on an instantaneous basis and then compile precipitation statistics over time for accurate climatological determinations. The inclined orbit of the GPM–CO results in sampling the entire diurnal (day–night) cycle of precipitation, which is key information for validating numerical models. By combining the “best estimate” data from the GPM–CO with more frequent precipitation estimates from GPM constellation satellites results in the IMERG analyses (30-min resolution), which has allowed for the examination of fine-scale variations in all types of systems, the application of the IMERG NRT analyses for monitoring precipitation systems, and the use in a multitude of applications  (e.g., hydrology, agriculture, and health) that depend on fresh water availability information.In the tropics, the GPM–CO data have been combined with similar data from TRMM for a 25-year total observational record to study the rainfall structure and variations of tropical cyclones, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and the mean rainfall climate of the tropics. Tropical mesoscale systems have been tracked with the 30-minute IMERG data to understand their life cycles and contributions to climatological rainfall. Tropical cyclone precipitation has been analyzed to understand storm initiation and variations with time over various ocean basins. Hailstorms have been studied with specifically developed hail algorithms over various continents, with particular focus on the extremely intense storms over South America.In midlatitudes, the structure of large-scale cyclonic systems, including atmospheric rivers (ARs), have been examined, as well as their relation to moisture source regions and impact in driving heavy precipitation events. At higher latitudes, GPM’s focus on better precipitation retrievals –  especially related to snow detection and estimation –  has led to improved knowledge of storm systems in this important, changing environment. Looking across the globe, extreme precipitation events – often with accompanying flood and landslide events – have also been examined and cataloged, both on a local and regional basis, but with increasing ability on a quasi-global basis as the time record extends forward. On longer timescales, the GPM–CO (and TRMM) data have contributed to our knowledge and estimates of mean climatological precipitation providing different estimates (from different products) for intercomparison and through “best estimate” ocean climatological values using combined radar data and passive microwave information from GPM, TRMM, and CloudSat. This best estimate is used to calibrate a new, long-term Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) monthly analysis (1983–present), which has resulted in a refined estimate of the mean ocean climatological value, that fits global water and energy budget studies better – see Figure 3. The GPM IMERG analyses are also now used as a key input to the GPCP global daily analyses, enabling finer-resolution climatological studies.Figure 3. Example of Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Daily Climate Data Record (CDR) for January 28, 2018. GPCP incorporates GPM–CO and IMERG information to produce maps like the one shown here. Image credit: Bob Adler/University of Maryland, College Park, Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center (ESSIC)]GPM Precipitation Estimates Improving Climate Models and Constraining PredictionsThe multifaceted, multiscale physical processes that affect precipitation locally and globally continue to be a challenge for climate models to accurately represent. Ongoing research and analysis reveals that the process-level representation is a much stronger constraint on climate model prediction fidelity than mean state climatological skill. Though high-quality climate models, such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), are currently not run at the resolution of GPM observations, they are increasingly simulating cloud and thunderstorm-scale rainfall as subcomponents within their lower-resolution grid boxes. This allows for the model-simulated rain intensity over thunderstorm areas to be compared with GPM precipitation estimates that are averaged over the equivalent GPM DPR-identified convective cloud types. This evaluation inevitably involves assessing extremes, and with 10 years and counting of GPM data now avaiable, such extremes in different weather regimes will be increasingly useful to study – see Figure 4.Figure 4. Average rainfall patterns from 2014–2020 in January using the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies’ (GISS) - E3 climate model [top] and precipitation estimates derived from GPM’s multisatellite product, IMERG [bottom]. Climate models such as the GISS-E3 must accurately simulate seasonal cycles observed by GPM for their predictions to be more reliable. Using the GPM rainfall magnitudes as benchmarks, new model equations are being developed to improve this area of rainfall simulation and improve climate projections. Image credit: Greg Elsaesser/GISS Additionally, the diurnal cycle of precipitation – another challenge for climate models to simulate – remains an important focus. Recent studies have suggested that the systematic differences in cloud occurrence across the diurnal cycle are crucially important for atmospheric water vapor changes as well as cloud feedbacks and their role in climate change. This expanded understanding provides even more motivation for improving diurnal cycle representation in models. With the long GPM record, diurnal precipitation composites can be made in varying weather or climate states (e.g., El Niño/Southern Oscillation), and additional novel analyses of regime-dependent diurnal cycle composites will be important for constraining processes.Figure 5. Schematic of GPM observed latent heating in convective cores (i.e., thunderstorms) relative to a larger thunderstorm complex (i.e., mesoscale convective system). Image credit: Greg Elsaesser; model is from a May 2022 paper published in Journal of Geophysical Research: AtmospheresAvailability of and improvements in GPM estimated stratiform rainfall will progressively enable addressing the longstanding deficiencies in simulating mesoscale convective systems – see Figure 5. Alongside use of “process-relevant” precipitation diagnostics, new efforts seek to use machine learning techniques to ensure that numerous climatological water and energy cycle diagnostics remain in good agreement with GPM and other satellite estimates. These joint efforts that leverage both mean-state global precipitation estimates plus the process-oriented precipitation diagnostics will ensure that coarser-resolution climate models that support numerous CMIP experiments will increase in predictive capability.GPM Applications: Continuing to Grow and Enable Communities Across Local and Global ScalesAs noted above, one GPM focus is the application of satellite precipitation estimates for societal decision-making. As a result, GPM data have supported applications such as weather forecasting, water resource management, agriculture and food security monitoring, public health, animal migration, tropical cyclone location and intensity estimation, hydropower management, flood and landslide monitoring and forecasting, and land system modeling – see Figure 6.Figure 6. GPM Applications icon highlights six thematic and primary societal application areas supported by GPM data: ecological management, water resources and agriculture, energy, disasters monitoring and response, public health, and weather and climate modeling.Image credit: GPM website; Mike Marosy/GSFC/Global Science and Technology Inc. (GST)To support this focus, the GPM Applications team strives to focus on engaging users through trainings and interviews, workshops, webinars, and programs, with the objective of guiding new and existing users to integrate GPM data into their systems and processes to drive actions that positively impact society. These activities help elucidate data needs and identify data barriers faced by stakeholders. The team also helps identify opportunities and gaps to create effective engagement and outreach resources and help facilitate the use of GPM data to support decision making and improve situational awareness across different sectors. All of these efforts have helped increase the visibility of GPM and attract new users from federal and state partners, academic institutions, international agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private and non-profit companies. A few examples of GPM Application engagement activities since launch include:three GPM Mentorship Programs that bridge the gap between GPM scientists and application communities to promote operational applications;seventeen GPM trainings to support new and existing users on data access and use for applications;six GPM stakeholder-driven application workshops to facilitate discussions between scientists and end users of GPM data about how NASA data could be better leveraged to inform decision making for societal applications; andthree white papers that articulate and identify user needs and data requirements across communities.The GPM Applications team has tabulated over 10,000+ unique users across 130 countries who have accessed or routinely access GPM data from NASA data archives. Additionally, the value of these activities can be seen in over 175 GPM case study application examples that have been publicized at NASA, featured on social media and posted at NASA GPM Applications webpage, over the last 5 years alone – see sampling of applications in Figure 7.Figure 7. Collage of GPM case study examples enabling societal applications, including weather forecasting, nowcasting of extremes, agricultural and drought monitoring, weather index insurance, and data management platforms.Image credit: Andrea Portier /GSFC/ SSAIOver the past decade of GPM observations, several themes have emerged with these efforts across the applications community. One key component of enabling GPM applications is the ability to access and download NRT data products that meet applications needs. About 40% of GPM end users rely on NRT GPM products for time-sensitive applications. Additionally, GPM’s global-gridded IMERG product plays a significant role for applications. It is used nearly 17 times more for research and applications compared to other GPM products, with ~30% of users accessing and downloading IMERG Early and Late NRT data and applying them towards operational uses. As noted earlier, the reprocessing of all TRMM precipitation-era data using the IMERG algorithm ensured a longer, continuous precipitation data record with consistent retrievals that are available from June 2000 to the present. The longer precipitation record has enabled new science research and data applications to benefit society across a diverse range of end-users, helping them to compare and contrast past and present data to support and develop more accurate climate and weather models, understand normal and anomalous extreme precipitation events, and strengthen the baseline information and situational awareness for applications, such as disasters, agriculture and food security, water resources, and energy production. Table 2 presents several broader examples of how these GPM data products are used for societal applications. The subsections that follow demonstrate the value of GPM data to facilitate research and applications even more through case studies.Table 2. The table includes examples of user communities, by organizational sectors, that highlight how GPM data products are being used for situational awareness and decision-making.

For example, the USAF ingests IMERG Early into its operational weather forecasts and advisories, supporting global land surface characterization capabilities. This information is then provided routinely to decision-makers across the military, agricultural, and research sectors.Water Resources, Agricultural Forecasting and Food SecurityGMI L1 TB products are operationally assimilated into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models across the globe to improve short- to long-term weather forecast quality (by tuning and developing microphysics and convection parameterizations) and correct the track forecasts for tropical cyclones. Agencies and organizations, such as NASA’s Global Modeling Assimilation Office (GMAO), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Hurricane Center (NHC), Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ingest GMI TB data to support their operational systems. For example, the all-sky assimilation of GMI Tb over ice-free ocean surfaces helps improve initial conditions and overall forecast quality to ECMWF’s 24-hour forecasts, increasing not only the number of satellite observations assimilated but also the types of variables analyzed, such as hydrometeors (e.g., liquid cloud, ice cloud, rain, and snow).GPM’s L2 precipitation and L3 IMERG products are used as input into hydrological and land surface models to better understand the land–atmosphere interactions and better predict and monitor water resources and agricultural output on scales ranging from days to years. For example, IMERG serves as a key component to Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System hydrology products that are designed to enhance agricultural monitoring in data-sparse regions and support humanitarian response initiatives. IMERG Early products are actively used as a data source for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service operations where IMERG estimates are routinely evaluated against World Meteorological Organization station data above 50˚N latitude for consensus to produce crop assessments in those regions and support extratropical agrometeorological crop monitoring. In the private sector, companies, such as Nutrien Ag Solutions, use IMERG Early precipitation estimates to capture and evaluate extreme precipitation events. This information is part of Nutrien’s daily delivery of weather content to the company and their clients, where these efforts help the clients prepare for potential disruptions across the global supply chain.Disaster Response and InsuranceThe IMERG spatial and temporal resolution – as well as the availability of the data across more than two decades –  has been invaluable for examining precipitation extremes that may result in flooding, landslides, drought, and fires. These data provide key situational awareness for disaster response and recovery. Rainfall information has been developed in Web Map Service (WMS) and ArcGIS formats with Representational State Transfer (REST) endpoints so that they can be pulled into geospatial portals at Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Army Geospatial Intelligence Unit and data management platform companies (e.g., CyStellar), and provided to the National Geospatial Agency, the State Department, and insurers. The IMERG product has also been critical to global disaster models, such as the near-global Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA) system, which uses NRT IMERG rainfall in a decision tree framework that issues a moderate or high landslide nowcast based on rainfall thresholds. The model is routinely updated with a latency of four hours. The LHASA versions are running routinely and used by U.S. agencies and international agencies and organizations, including the World Food Programme.IMERG data are also being used at multiple reinsurance companies, including the Microinsurance Catastrophe Risk Organisation (MiCRO), to develop drought and rainfall indices using climatology data from IMERG.Looking Across and Forward for ApplicationsCommon themes that have emerged in stakeholder feedback include the need for continuity of data products, identifying uncertainty estimates, having easily accessible case study examples, and creating public trainings for data access and use. The Applications team works closely with GPM members and leadership to ensure that there are clear and open communication pathways across the GPM mission on engagement activities and to accelerate stakeholder feedback to GPM algorithm developers to aid in the improvement of GPM data products and services for the public. In addition, these insights can be used to formulate a framework for applications related to future mission planning, e.g., NASA’s Earth System Observatory missions.Bridging the Gap Between Precipitation Measurements and the Public: A View into Outreach EffortsSeveral years before the launch of GPM, the Education and Public Outreach (EPO) team was busy in the background, working to bring Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) into the classroom and taking advantage of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) that were being implemented in curriculums across the U.S. The launch of GPM offered a perfect opportunity to showcase and amplify the incredible science and technology behind the GPM mission and the myriad of potential applications that could stem from its data.Early in the GPM mission's development, the GPM EPO team curated existing NASA educational resources related to the themes of Earth’s water cycle, weather and climate, technology behind Earth Observing missions, and societal applications. The EPO team created a website, entitled Precipitation Education that has been wildly successful from its launch. The team also developed a Rain EnGAUGE toolkit and engaged both formal and informal educators from around the world to host “Family Science Night” programs and implement some of the interactive activities that the team developed for these events. Thus, even before the launch of GPM, the EPO effort had momentum as team members shared the incredible ways in which NASA’s Earth observation systems were helping us to better understand and protect our home planet.After launch, the EPO Team worked annually with international teams of “GPM Master Teachers.” This process selected teachers, who participated throughout the school year and received a small stipend for their work. They helped to align the science behind the GPM mission and other NASA Earth observation systems with the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program and developed many lessons and activities that were made available to educators around the globe.The EPO team also worked with NASA’s Earth to Sky program, training National Park Service and other interpreters to understand the science behind the GPM mission, and to find ways to share this information in meaningful and relevant ways with their audiences across the U.S.Newer activities have been developed to enable the general public to interact with open science as they follow a very easy “data recipe” to retrieve GPM precipitation observations since 2000 for their location. They are encouraged to use the GLOBE program’s app, GLOBE Observer, and take an observation of either a tree height or clouds. Contributors input the latitude and longitude from that location and find out how much precipitation fell for that location since 2000. This gives the participants the opportunity to collect data from the ground, and then look at satellite data for that same location to better understand the impact of precipitation in their local environment. GLOBE Participants can share their Tree Stories and Water Stories and compare their data with others around the world.In addition to providing a wide suite of online resources, the GPM Outreach team attends many public events each year, ranging from large NASA-sponsored Earth Day events to local family STEM nights – see Photos 2 and 3. The GPM Outreach team has developed many hands-on activities that help the public explore the varied amounts of precipitation falling in locations around the world. By interacting with these activities and learning how NASA is helping us better understand and protect our home planet, participants walk away with a richer understanding of how NASA’s Earth science programs are improving life around the world.A decade after the launch of GPM, the “Precipitation Education” website continues to be incredibly popular, with an average of 90,000 visits per month. GPM education and outreach resources are considered the state of the art among practitioners, and the team updates existing and adds new resources as opportunities arise.Photo 2.

With a robust validation program and successive algorithm improvements, our knowledge of precipitation distribution across the globe continues to advance. This has had measurable effects on global modeling and weather forecasting, real-time severe weather monitoring, education, and many other areas. With hardware continuing to function – and a recent fuel-saving orbit boost – GPM continues to add to this valuable data record. The community’s experience with GPM helps illustrate what new observations or combinations of observations will be needed in coming decades to advance precipitation science and maintain needed global monitoring. GPM’s cohort of researchers, instrument specialists, mission operators, and other key personnel across the community are providing the backbone of future mission development efforts.AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to acknowledge several contributing members of the Global Precipitation Measurement Science Team who played a part in writing this anniversary article.

href=\"https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/GPM\">Global Precipitation Measurement</a> (GPM) Core Observatory (CO) spacecraft launched aboard a Japanese H-IIA rocket from Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan. On that day, the GPM mission, a joint Earth-observing mission between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), began its journey to provide the world with an unprecedented picture of global precipitation (i.e., rain and snow). GPM continues to observe important precipitation characteristics and gain physical insights into precipitation processes using an advanced radar and passive microwave (PMW) radiometer on the GPM–CO along with leveraging a constellation of satellites. (The Earth Observer <em>reported on the GPM–CO launch and plans for the mission in its November–December 2013 issue – see <a href=\"https://eospso.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/eo_pdfs/Nov_Dec_2013_final_color.pdf#page=4\">GPM Core Observatory: Advancing Precipitation Instruments and Expanding Coverage</a>.) </em></p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">As GPM is now well into its 10<sup>th</sup> year in orbit, the time is fitting to reflect on and celebrate what this mission has accomplished and showcase its contributions to science and society. While occasionally dealing with equipment malfunction, the GPM–CO has operated nearly continuously over its lifetime and recently was put into a higher orbit to conserve station-keeping fuel. As a result, GPM remains in extended operations and continues its observations after 10 years, making significant advances in the precipitation field through improving sensor calibration, retrieval algorithms, and ground validation measurements. GPM data continues to further our understanding of the characteristics of liquid and frozen precipitation around the world and improving our scientific knowledge of Earth's water and energy cycles. These advances have extended to numerous societal benefits related to operational weather prediction, situational awareness and prediction of extreme events, hydrological and climate model development, water resource and crop management activities, and public health alerts. Additionally, this information has informed the K–12 and post-secondary audiences, influencing the next generation of scientists.

The distribution, frequency, and extremes in precipitation affect everything from agriculture to the insurance industry, to travel and your weekend plans. Prior to the meteorological satellite era, precipitation observations were limited to populated areas leaving wide swaths of land and almost the entirety of the oceans (70% of Earth’s surface) unobserved. GPM builds on decades of advances in satellite precipitation observations.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">Early precipitation observations from space (e.g., from the <a href=\"https://eospso.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/eo_pdfs/Mar_Apr_2015_color_508.pdf#page=18\">Nimbus series</a>) used visible and infrared measurements that gave the first, approximate estimates. PMW radiometers, however, gave a next generation of more direct and improved precipitation measurement. The NASA–JAXA <a href=\"https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/trmm\">Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission</a> (TRMM), launched in November 1997, significantly advanced the field with the addition of a Precipitation Radar (PR) alongside a wider-swath PMW radiometer. This was groundbreaking for precipitation research and advancement of measurement techniques, but was limited to the tropics and a single satellite in low Earth orbit. To move toward the goal of a globally distributed, high-frequency, physically consistent satellite precipitation product a new mission design was conceived in GPM.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\"><strong>The GPM Mission: Science Requirements, Objectives, and Instruments</strong></p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">The GPM–CO spacecraft is an advanced successor to the TRMM spacecraft, providing additional channels on both the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) to enhance capabilities to sense light rain and falling snow.

Each GPM Constellation partner designed and operated the satellites for their own particular missions, but they agreed to share the data from their missions to enable the next-generation of unified global precipitation estimates. The combination of these partner satellites and the GPM–CO allow frequent intersections of their orbits, permitting colocated and cotemporal observations to be made, which are crucial to ensure effective intercalibration.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">The GPM–CO serves as the “calibrator” to unify precipitation estimates across these different partners’ satellite sensors, ensuring that the observed microwave brightness temperatures (T<sub>B</sub>) are consistent among the sensors with expected differences after accounting for variations in the observing frequencies, bandwidths, polarizations, and view angles. The advanced calibration across the sensors is a remarkable achievement, and it allows the project to focus on the precipitation products rather than T<sub>B</sub> uncertainties. This careful calibration enables high-quality datasets that support and enable detailed investigations on the distribution of precipitation and how these patterns change over days, seasons, and years, enabling a breadth of science and societal applications at local and global scales.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\"><strong>Ground Validation Activities: Significant Contributions to the GPM Mission</strong></p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">An integral part of a successful satellite mission is a robust and active ground validation (GV) program. During the TRMM era, the TRMM PR, and/or the TRMM PMW radiometer instruments limited GV to simple comparisons of rain rates to surface measurements from radars and/or rain gauges, which is referred to as <em>statistical validation</em>. It soon became obvious that a more robust GV program would be needed to better aid future satellite algorithm developers to improve the physics of their algorithms rather than just justifying tweaking their outputs. As a result, unlike TRMM, GPM’s GV program has been part of the mission concept from its inception. The GPM team developed a three-tiered approach that uses: &nbsp;<em>statistical validation</em>, as done during TRMM; <em>physical validation, </em>where the emphasis is on better understanding of the physics and microphysics of different precipitating systems; and <em>hydrological validation</em>, which emphasizes improving precipitation retrievals over large-scale areas (e.g., watersheds).</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">To address these goals, there have been several pre- and post-launch field campaigns conducted.

For example, MC3E allowed for comprehensive observations of intense convection over continental regions. The researchers deployed an extensive network of ground instruments (e.g., radars, disdrometers, rain gauges), in coordination with flights of NASA’s ER-2 and University of North Dakota’s Cessna <em>Citation II </em>research aircrafts, to sample varied precipitation types (e.g., severe thunderstorms, Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS)). Data from MC3E allowed for improvement of both active (DPR) and passive (GMI) retrievals over land. GCPEx has allowed for sampling of snowing systems. During this campaign, NASA’s ER-2 flew high above the clouds in coordination with NASA’s DC-3 aircraft flying within the clouds. Here again, GCPEx participants deployed a vast network of ground instruments (e.g., snow gauges, disdrometers). The goal for GCPEx was to formulate and validate frozen/mixed precipitation retrievals from the GPM satellite. (Note that from 2011–2015, <em>The Earth Observer</em> published articles on five of the six GV campaigns described in this section; the reader can locate these articles on <em>The Earth Observer</em> <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/the-earth-observer/archives/\">Archives Page</a>.

In order to provide long-term measurements at reasonable costs, the GPM GV established the Precipitation Research Facility (PRF) at the Wallops Flight Facility (WFF). The goal of this facility was to provide long-term measurements from the myriad instruments that have been deployed at the various field campaigns and manage them with full-time GV personnel. The linchpin of the PRF is <a href=\"https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/sensors/npol\">NASA’s S-band, Dual-Polarimetric Radar</a> (NPOL) – see <strong>Photo 1</strong>. NPOL was deployed in a farm field about 38 km (~24 mi) northeast of WFF to provide areal estimates of surface precipitation as well as profiles of precipitating systems above other GV surface instruments (e.g., profiling radars, disdrometers, and rain gauges). To add to this effort, the PRF staff established a network of rain gauges and disdrometers, which are deployed over the eastern shore of Maryland. These data are telemetered so that an added benefit to this effort is that the GPM GV data provide valuable, near-real-time data to many of the numerous farmers on the Delmarva Peninsula. The PRF’s principal activity is to design new GV instruments, test new validation methods, and assess instrument uncertainties using the abundant infrastructure of the GPM GV validation program. This coordination between GPM GV instruments, WFF-based staff, and regional data collection, quality control, and analysis are the core components of the PRF.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-5 desktop:margin-y-6\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module hds-media wp-block-image CoreImageBlock\"><div class=\"margin-left-auto margin-right-auto nasa-block-align-inline\"><!--[--><div class=\"hds-media-wrapper margin-left-auto margin-right-auto\"><figure class=\"hds-media-inner hds-cover-wrapper hds-media-ratio-fit\"><picture class=\"BaseMedia width-full\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 320px, (max-width: 768px) 640px, (max-width: 1024px) 768px, (max-width: 1280px) 1024px, (max-width: 1536px) 1280px, 2048px\" srcset=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=320&amp;format=webp 320w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=640&amp;format=webp 640w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=768&amp;format=webp 768w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;format=webp 1024w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=1280&amp;format=webp 1280w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=1536&amp;format=webp 1536w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;format=webp 2048w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=2560&amp;format=webp 2560w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=3072&amp;format=webp 3072w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=4096&amp;format=webp 4096w\" type=\"image/webp\"><img src=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=4096&amp;format=jpeg\" height=\"988\" style=\"transform:scale(1);transform-origin:50% 50%;object-position:50% 50%;object-fit:cover;\" class=\"width-full\" onerror=\"this.setAttribute('data-error', 1)\" width=\"1440\" data-nuxt-pic=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 320px, (max-width: 768px) 640px, (max-width: 1024px) 768px, (max-width: 1280px) 1024px, (max-width: 1536px) 1280px, 2048px\" alt=\"GPM Photo 1\" srcset=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=320&amp;format=jpeg 320w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=640&amp;format=jpeg 640w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=768&amp;format=jpeg 768w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;format=jpeg 1024w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=1280&amp;format=jpeg 1280w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=1536&amp;format=jpeg 1536w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;format=jpeg 2048w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=2560&amp;format=jpeg 2560w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=3072&amp;format=jpeg 3072w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-photo-1.jpg?w=4096&amp;format=jpeg 4096w\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure><figcaption class=\"hds-caption padding-top-2\"><div class=\"hds-caption-text p-sm margin-0\"><strong>Photo 1. </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/sensors/npol\">NASA S-Band Dual Polarimetric Radar</a> (NPOL) deployed in central Iowa in support of the IFloodS field campaign in Iowa during the spring of 2013.

One of the key mission requirements of the PPS was to ensure that processing and reprocessing always include data from the TRMM era (starting in December 1997). Algorithm development would ensure that the same algorithm would be used to process both TRMM- and GPM-era data collected from the TRMM and GPM spacecrafts and the GPM constellation. As a result, an important part of this cross-mission processing is the intercalibration of PMW radiometers using GMI. Using data from the overlap period of GMI and TMI, TMI is intercalibrated to GMI and is then used to intercalibrate the radiometer data during the TRMM era. This intercalibration manifests itself in the intercalibrated brightness temperatures (T<sub>c</sub>) provided in the Level 1C (L1C) product for each radiometer. The GPM Profiling Algorithm (GPROF) retrieval uses these intercalibrated L1C products and guarantees consistent mission intercalibrated precipitation retrievals. For example, the L2 product stage that converts T<sub>B</sub> into precipitation estimates applies the same GPROF to the GPM constellation of PMW radiometers.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\"><em>Continued Improvement of GPM Algorithms</em></p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">One important achievement of GPM is the continued improvements in GPM’s algorithms that produce the immense amount of precipitation data that are used by scientific researchers and stakeholders alike. <a href=\"https://gpm.nasa.gov/science/precipitation-algorithms\">GPM’s five algorithms</a> – DPR-, GPROF-, Combined-, Convective-Stratiform Heating-, and Multisatellite – have all undergone version updates several times (e.g., Version 01–07), with additional updates planned for the next 1–4 years. Each update entails a tremendous amount of work behind the scenes from GPM’s algorithm developers to ensure that quality data are available to the public.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">Each new version provides a complete reprocessing of the entire data record using the improved retrieval algorithms, based on validation against reliable GV data, feedback from users, new understanding of the processes, and improved techniques. This not only helps ensure a consistent data record and fair comparisons against past events but also helps refine and improve the data to capture precipitation phenomena more exactly. Just as an original photograph capturing a past event can be reanalyzed with new technology, reprocessing revisits the observed satellite instruments’ “raw” radiances and refines the process of converting them to the end product of precipitation quantities.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\"><em>“We know more now about the global rain and snowfall in, say, 2010, than we did when it actually happened.” – </em><strong>George Huffman</strong><em> </em>[GPM Project Scientist]</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">This process is an <em>inverse problem</em> that helps determine the physical quantities (e.g., precipitation rate) given the observed signal (e.g., microwave radiance). For precipitation, this retrieval process relies on complex algorithms and is by no means straightforward. This is an underconstrained problem where different combinations of physical quantities can give the same observed signal, especially for passive instruments. Thus it requires additional information or assumptions.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">The aim of each version in GPM is to have \"better\" estimates of the precipitation variables than the previous version. However, what better means can involve trade-offs. An excellent example is a change implemented from V06 to V07 in one of GPM’s most widely-used products – the <a href=\"https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/imerg\">Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM</a> (IMERG) algorithm – which is NASA GPM’s multisatellite product that combines information from the GPM satellite constellation to estimate precipitation over the majority of the Earth's surface. The resulting IMERG products provide near-global precipitation data at a resolution of 10 km (~6mi), every 30 minutes covering latitudes of 60°N–60°S, and are available at different latencies (<em>Early</em>, <em>Late</em>, and <em>Final</em>, as defined in Table 1) to cater to a range of end-user communities for operational and research applications. IMERG is particularly valuable over areas of Earth's surface that lack ground-based, precipitation-measuring instruments, including oceans and remote areas. Specifically, this change to IMERG V07 resulted in improvements towards the distribution of precipitation rates, allowing for a better representation of precipitation areas and extremes. However, it reduced correlation against ground reference data. Another example is the gauge adjustment process in IMERG that offers a substantial improvement at the expense of higher random error.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">The result of these intricate reprocessing cycles is a family of precipitation products that improves accuracy, a longer record, and expanding coverage, all while responding to feedback and requests from users. This is especially the case for downstream products like IMERG, which is widely used for science and applications due to its completeness and regularity, and inherits the improvements in each reprocessing cycle across the family.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\"><em>Meeting User Needs</em></p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">The number one requirement on PPS was to provide well-curated standard reference products with carefully curated provenience.

Measurements of the vertical structure of clouds are fundamentally important to improving our understanding of how they affect both local- and large-scale environments. Achieving this goal has required considerable enhancement of the NASA GPM algorithms – including the DPR, GPROF, Combined (CMB), and <a href=\"https://gpm.nasa.gov/resources/documents/goddard-convective-stratiform-heating-csh-algorithm\">Convective–Stratiform (Latent) Heating (</a>CSH) algorithms – from their original capabilities at the time of launch.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">The advanced instrumentation of GPM’s dual-frequency, K<sub>u</sub>/K<sub>a</sub>-band radar added new capabilities beyond the TRMM PR’s single K<sub>u</sub> band. As a result, the DPR algorithms provide vertical hydrometeor profiles at the radar range bin level [~5 km (~3 mi) horizontal, 125 m (~410 ft) vertical]. Such detailed measurements are critical for classifying precipitation events (e.g., convective or stratiform) and characterizing the dominant types of precipitation particles, precipitation characteristics, and freezing level height. Additionally, these DPR algorithms have played a significant role in retrieving parameters of the particle size distribution (PSD) in rain. All of these factors help support and elucidate the understanding of storm systems and their impacts at local and regional scales.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">More recently falling snow microphysics have received increasing attention.  Characterizing snow remains a challenging problem for precipitation measuring/modeling due to varying particle habits, shapes, and snow mass densities. The higher frequencies added on both the DPR and GMI instruments have enabled improved observations of ice and snow, not only revealing new insights into the intensity and microphysical composition of cold-season precipitation but enabling an increased understanding of precipitation, clouds, and <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/nasa_science/science/\">climate feedbacks</a>. </p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">Another important parameter that is derived from GPM vertical profile information is <em>latent heating</em> (LH), which is so named because it measures the “hidden” energy when water changes phase but doesn’t impact its temperature. The vertical structure of LH is a key parameter for understanding the coupling of the Earth’s water and energy cycles. Although it cannot be directly observed, GPM-derived precipitation estimates, microphysical properties, and vertical structure provide critical information for inferring the vertical structure of LH –  see <strong>Figure 2</strong>. Researchers can access this information using the <a href=\"https://gpm.nasa.gov/resources/documents/goddard-convective-stratiform-heating-csh-algorithm\">U.S. Science Team’s CSH datasets</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/GPM/doc/algorithm/GPM_SLH_V06B_ATBD_20200706_fin.pdf\">Japanese Science Team’s Spectral Latent Heating (LSH) datasets</a>. GPM’s sampling of higher latitudes –  not available from TRMM ­–  has resulted in estimates of the intensity and variability of 3D LH structures of precipitation systems beyond the tropics. The CSH algorithm has advanced during the GPM era due to improvements in numerical cloud models and higher accuracy vertical precipitation structure profiles.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\"><em>Improve knowledge of Precipitation Systems, Water Cycle Variability, and Freshwater Availability</em></p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">A key success of GPM – <strong> </strong>both from information from the GPM–CO and from combining with the information from the constellation satellites – is the expansion of knowledge of precipitation systems both in the tropics and at middle and high latitudes. In addition, the program contributes to water availability and variations in time and space. The radar and PMW instruments on the GPM–CO lead to the most accurate surface precipitation rate estimates and vertical structure of the systems, allowing researchers to study key features of these systems on an instantaneous basis and then compile precipitation statistics over time for accurate climatological determinations. The inclined orbit of the GPM–CO results in sampling the entire <em>diurnal</em> (day–night) cycle of precipitation, which is key information for validating numerical models. By combining the “best estimate” data from the GPM–CO with more frequent precipitation estimates from GPM constellation satellites results in the IMERG analyses (30-min resolution), which has allowed for the examination of fine-scale variations in all types of systems, the application of the IMERG NRT analyses for monitoring precipitation systems, and the use in a multitude of applications&nbsp; (e.g., hydrology, agriculture, and health) that depend on fresh water availability information.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">In the tropics, the GPM–CO data have been combined with similar data from TRMM for a 25-year total observational record to study the rainfall structure and variations of tropical cyclones, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and the mean rainfall climate of the tropics.

Ongoing research and analysis reveals that the process-level representation is a much stronger constraint on climate model prediction fidelity than mean state climatological skill. Though high-quality climate models, such as the <a href=\"https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip\">Coupled Model Intercomparison Project</a> (CMIP), are currently not run at the resolution of GPM observations, they are increasingly simulating cloud and thunderstorm-scale rainfall as subcomponents within their lower-resolution grid boxes. This allows for the model-simulated rain intensity over thunderstorm areas to be compared with GPM precipitation estimates that are averaged over the equivalent GPM DPR-identified convective cloud types.

Recent studies have suggested that the systematic differences in cloud occurrence across the diurnal cycle are crucially important for atmospheric water vapor changes as well as cloud feedbacks and their role in climate change. This expanded understanding provides even more motivation for improving diurnal cycle representation in models. With the long GPM record, diurnal precipitation composites can be made in varying weather or climate states (e.g., El Niño/Southern Oscillation), and additional novel analyses of regime-dependent diurnal cycle composites will be important for constraining processes.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-5 desktop:margin-y-6\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module hds-media wp-block-image CoreImageBlock\"><div class=\"margin-left-auto margin-right-auto nasa-block-align-inline\"><!--[--><div class=\"hds-media-wrapper margin-left-auto margin-right-auto\"><figure class=\"hds-media-inner hds-cover-wrapper hds-media-ratio-fit\"><picture class=\"BaseMedia width-full\"><source srcset=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=320&amp;format=webp 320w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=640&amp;format=webp 640w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=768&amp;format=webp 768w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=1024&amp;format=webp 1024w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=1280&amp;format=webp 1280w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=1536&amp;format=webp 1536w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=2048&amp;format=webp 2048w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=2560&amp;format=webp 2560w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=3072&amp;format=webp 3072w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=4096&amp;format=webp 4096w\" type=\"image/webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 320px, (max-width: 768px) 640px, (max-width: 1024px) 768px, (max-width: 1280px) 1024px, (max-width: 1536px) 1280px, 2048px\"><img alt=\"GPM Figure 5\" data-nuxt-pic=\"\" src=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=4096&amp;format=png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 320px, (max-width: 768px) 640px, (max-width: 1024px) 768px, (max-width: 1280px) 1024px, (max-width: 1536px) 1280px, 2048px\" onerror=\"this.setAttribute('data-error', 1)\" style=\"transform:scale(1);transform-origin:50% 50%;object-position:50% 50%;object-fit:cover;\" srcset=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=320&amp;format=png 320w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=640&amp;format=png 640w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=768&amp;format=png 768w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=1024&amp;format=png 1024w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=1280&amp;format=png 1280w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=1536&amp;format=png 1536w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=2048&amp;format=png 2048w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=2560&amp;format=png 2560w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=3072&amp;format=png 3072w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gpm-figure-5.png?w=4096&amp;format=png 4096w\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1440\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"975\" class=\"width-full\"></picture></figure><figcaption class=\"hds-caption padding-top-2\"><div class=\"hds-caption-text p-sm margin-0\"><strong>Figure 5. </strong>Schematic of GPM observed latent heating in convective cores (i.e., thunderstorms) relative to a larger thunderstorm complex (i.e., mesoscale convective system).</div><div class=\"hds-credits\"> <strong>Image credit</strong>: Greg Elsaesser; model is from a May 2022 paper published in <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021JD035599\">Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres</a></div></figcaption></div><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">Availability of and improvements in GPM estimated stratiform rainfall will progressively enable addressing the longstanding deficiencies in simulating mesoscale convective systems – see <strong>Figure 5</strong>.

One key component of enabling GPM applications is the ability to access and download NRT data products that meet applications needs. About 40% of GPM end users rely on NRT GPM products for time-sensitive applications. Additionally, GPM’s global-gridded IMERG product plays a significant role for applications. It is used nearly 17 times more for research and applications compared to other GPM products, with ~30% of users accessing and downloading IMERG Early and Late NRT data and applying them towards operational uses. As noted earlier, the reprocessing of all TRMM precipitation-era data using the IMERG algorithm ensured a longer, continuous precipitation data record with consistent retrievals that are available from June 2000 to the present. The longer precipitation record has enabled new science research and data applications to benefit society across a diverse range of end-users, helping them to compare and contrast past and present data to support and develop more accurate climate and weather models, understand normal and anomalous extreme precipitation events, and strengthen the baseline information and situational awareness for applications, such as disasters, agriculture and food security, water resources, and energy production. <strong>Table 2</strong> presents several broader examples of how these GPM data products are used for societal applications.

For example, the all-sky assimilation of GMI T<sub>b</sub> over ice-free ocean surfaces helps improve initial conditions and overall forecast quality to ECMWF’s 24-hour forecasts, increasing not only the number of satellite observations assimilated but also the types of variables analyzed, such as hydrometeors (e.g., liquid cloud, ice cloud, rain, and snow).</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">GPM’s L2 precipitation and L3 IMERG products are used as input into hydrological and land surface models to better understand the land–atmosphere interactions and better predict and monitor water resources and agricultural output on scales ranging from days to years. For example, IMERG serves as a key component to <a href=\"https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/fldas\">Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System</a> hydrology products that are designed to enhance agricultural monitoring in data-sparse regions and support humanitarian response initiatives. IMERG Early products are actively used as a data source for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service operations where IMERG estimates are routinely evaluated against World Meteorological Organization station data above 50˚N latitude for consensus to produce crop assessments in those regions and support extratropical agrometeorological crop monitoring. In the private sector, companies, such as <a href=\"https://nutrienagsolutions.com/\">Nutrien Ag Solutions</a>, use IMERG Early precipitation estimates to capture and evaluate extreme precipitation events. This information is part of Nutrien’s daily delivery of weather content to the company and their clients, where these efforts help the clients prepare for potential disruptions across the global supply chain.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\"><em>Disaster Response and Insurance</em></p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">The IMERG spatial and temporal resolution – as well as the availability of the data across more than two decades –  has been invaluable for examining precipitation extremes that may result in flooding, landslides, drought, and fires. These data provide key situational awareness for disaster response and recovery. Rainfall information has been developed in Web Map Service (WMS) and ArcGIS formats with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST\">Representational State Transfer</a> (REST) endpoints so that they can be pulled into geospatial portals at Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Army Geospatial Intelligence Unit and data management platform companies (e.g., CyStellar), and provided to the National Geospatial Agency, the State Department, and insurers. The IMERG product has also been critical to global disaster models, such as the near-global <a href=\"https://gpm.nasa.gov/landslides/projects.html\">Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness</a> (LHASA) system, which uses NRT IMERG rainfall in a decision tree framework that issues a moderate or high landslide nowcast based on rainfall thresholds. The <a href=\"https://landslides.nasa.gov/\">model is routinely updated</a> with a latency of four hours.

With a robust validation program and successive algorithm improvements, our knowledge of precipitation distribution across the globe continues to advance. This has had measurable effects on global modeling and weather forecasting, real-time severe weather monitoring, education, and many other areas. With hardware continuing to function – and a recent fuel-saving orbit boost – GPM continues to add to this valuable data record. The community’s experience with GPM helps illustrate what new observations or combinations of observations will be needed in coming decades to advance precipitation science and maintain needed global monitoring. GPM’s cohort of researchers, instrument specialists, mission operators, and other key personnel across the community are providing the backbone of future mission development efforts.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-5 desktop:margin-y-6\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module hds-media wp-block-image CoreImageBlock\"><div class=\"margin-left-auto margin-right-auto nasa-block-align-inline\"><!--[--><div class=\"hds-media-wrapper margin-left-auto margin-right-auto\"><figure class=\"hds-media-inner hds-cover-wrapper hds-media-ratio-fit\"><picture class=\"BaseMedia width-full\"><source srcset=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=320&amp;format=webp 320w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=640&amp;format=webp 640w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=768&amp;format=webp 768w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=1024&amp;format=webp 1024w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=1280&amp;format=webp 1280w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=1536&amp;format=webp 1536w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=2048&amp;format=webp 2048w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=2560&amp;format=webp 2560w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=3072&amp;format=webp 3072w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=4096&amp;format=webp 4096w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 320px, (max-width: 768px) 640px, (max-width: 1024px) 768px, (max-width: 1280px) 1024px, (max-width: 1536px) 1280px, 2048px\" type=\"image/webp\"><img data-nuxt-pic=\"\" src=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=4096&amp;format=png\" alt=\"Black Separator Line\" srcset=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=320&amp;format=png 320w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=640&amp;format=png 640w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=768&amp;format=png 768w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=1024&amp;format=png 1024w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=1280&amp;format=png 1280w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=1536&amp;format=png 1536w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=2048&amp;format=png 2048w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=2560&amp;format=png 2560w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=3072&amp;format=png 3072w, https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eo-blackseparator-line.png?w=4096&amp;format=png 4096w\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"transform:scale(1);transform-origin:50% 50%;object-position:50% 50%;object-fit:cover;\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 320px, (max-width: 768px) 640px, (max-width: 1024px) 768px, (max-width: 1280px) 1024px, (max-width: 1536px) 1280px, 2048px\" decoding=\"async\" onerror=\"this.setAttribute('data-error', 1)\" width=\"1037\" height=\"24\" class=\"width-full\"></picture></figure><!----></div><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\"><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">The authors wish to acknowledge several contributing members of the Global Precipitation Measurement Science Team who played a part in writing this anniversary article.

Ice would be a valuable resource for future lunar expeditions. Water could be used for radiation protection and supporting human explorers, or broken into its hydrogen and oxygen components to make rocket fuel, energy, and breathable air.Prior studies found signs of ice in the larger permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) near the lunar South Pole, including areas within Cabeus, Haworth, Shoemaker and Faustini craters. In the new work, “We find that there is widespread evidence of water ice within PSRs outside the South Pole, towards at least 77 degrees south latitude,” said Dr. Timothy P. McClanahan of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of a paper on this research published October 2 in the Planetary Science Journal.The study further aids lunar mission planners by providing maps and identifying the surface characteristics that show where ice is likely and less likely to be found, with evidence for why that should be. “Our model and analysis show that greatest ice concentrations are expected to occur near the PSRs’ coldest locations below 75 Kelvin (-198°C or -325°F) and near the base of the PSRs’ poleward-facing slopes,” said McClanahan.This illustration shows the distribution of permanently shadowed regions (in blue) on the Moon poleward of 80 degrees South latitude. They are superimposed on a digital elevation map of the lunar surface (grey) from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter instrument on board NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft.NASA/GSFC/Timothy P. McClanahan“We can’t accurately determine the volume of the PSRs’ ice deposits or identify if they might be buried under a dry layer of regolith. However, we expect that for each surface 1.2 square yards (square meter) residing over these deposits there should be at least about five more quarts (five more liters) of ice within the surface top 3.3 feet (meter), as compared to their surrounding areas,” said McClanahan. The study also mapped where fewer, smaller, or lower-concentration ice deposits would be expected, occurring primarily towards warmer, periodically illuminated areas.Ice could become implanted in lunar regolith through comet and meteor impacts, released as vapor (gas) from the lunar interior, or be formed by chemical reactions between hydrogen in the solar wind and oxygen in the regolith. PSRs typically occur in topographic depressions near the lunar poles. Because of the low Sun angle, these areas haven’t seen sunlight for up to billions of years, so are perpetually in extreme cold. Ice molecules are thought to be repeatedly dislodged from the regolith by meteorites, space radiation, or sunlight and travel across the lunar surface until they land in a PSR where they are entrapped by extreme cold. The PSR’s continuously cold surfaces can preserve ice molecules near the surface for perhaps billions of years, where they may accumulate into a deposit that is rich enough to mine. Ice is thought to be quickly lost on surfaces that are exposed to direct sunlight, which precludes their accumulations.  The team used LRO’s Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) instrument to detect signs of ice deposits by measuring moderate-energy, “epithermal” neutrons. Specifically, the team used LEND’s Collimated Sensor for Epithermal Neutrons (CSETN) that has a fixed 18.6-mile (30-kilometer) diameter field-of-view. Neutrons are created by high-energy galactic cosmic rays that come from powerful deep-space events such as exploding stars, that impact the lunar surface, break up regolith atoms, and scatter subatomic particles called neutrons. The neutrons, which can originate from up to about a 3.3-foot (meter’s) depth, ping-pong their way through the regolith, running into other atoms. Some get directed into space, where they can be detected by LEND.  Since hydrogen is about the same mass as a neutron, a collision with hydrogen causes the neutron to lose relatively more energy than a collision with most common regolith elements. So, where hydrogen is present in regolith, its concentration creates a corresponding reduction in the observed number of moderate-energy neutrons.“We hypothesized that if all PSRs have the same hydrogen concentration, then CSETN should proportionally detect their hydrogen concentrations as a function of their areas. So, more hydrogen should be observed towards the larger-area PSRs,” said McClanahan.The model was developed from a theoretical study that demonstrated how similarly hydrogen-enhanced PSRs would be detected by CSETNs fixed-area field-of-view. The correlation was demonstrated using the neutron emissions from 502 PSRs with areas ranging from 1.5 square miles (4 km2) to 417 square miles (1079 km2) that contrasted against their surrounding less hydrogen-enhanced areas. The correlation was expectedly weak for the small PSRs but increased towards the larger-area PSRs.The research was sponsored by the LRO project science team, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center’s Artificial Intelligence Working Group, and NASA grant award number 80GSFC21M0002. The study was conducted using NASA's LRO Diviner radiometer and Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter instruments. The LEND instrument was developed by the Russian Space Agency, Roscosmos by its Space Research Institute (IKI). LEND was integrated to the LRO spacecraft at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. LRO is managed by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington.","html":"<div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module padding-top-5 padding-bottom-3 desktop:padding-right-3 width-full maxw-full wp-block-nasa-blocks-article-intro NasaBlocksArticleIntroBlock\"><!--[--><div class=\"width-full maxw-full article-header\"><div class=\"margin-bottom-2 width-full maxw-full\"><p class=\"label carbon-60 margin-0 margin-bottom-3 padding-0\">5 min read</p><h1 class=\"display-48 margin-bottom-2 margin-top-0\">NASA’s LRO: Lunar Ice Deposits are Widespread</h1></div></div><!--]--></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">Deposits of ice in lunar dust and rock (regolith) are more extensive than previously thought, according to a new analysis of data from NASA’s LRO (<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lro/\">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>) mission.

At Johnson Space Center in Houston, the heroes might train their colleagues how to safely respond and evacuate their office in an emergency. They might investigate office accidents and remove potential hazards. Or they might help fix a leaky bathroom sink or a broken coffee maker.\n\nThose heroes are approximately 135 on-site facility managers who ensure the safety and health of every building and its occupants.\n\nEstablished in 2009, the Facility Manager program encompasses buildings at Johnson Space Center, Sonny Carter Training Facility, and Ellington Field. Each building has a primary Facility Manager and an alternate. These individuals develop emergency action plans and serve as facility fire wardens. They post safety alerts, notices of renovation and construction work, and share information about impending interruptions to building access or utilities. They also coordinate between building occupants, safety personnel, facility operations, and emergency responders as needed.\n\n“We are a relatively close-knit community and rely on each other for assistance and advice, especially from the veteran facility managers,” said Vanessa Jordan, the lead facility manager for the entire Johnson site. Her role, and that of Alternate Lead Facility Manager Darrell Palmer, is to establish policies and procedures for the Facility Manager program, ensuring that all applicable safety and health regulations are disseminated and enforced site wide.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson Space Center Lead Facility Manager Vanessa Jordan (left) and Alternate Lead Facility Manager Darrell Palmer.\n\n\n\n“We are responsible for advising the facility managers on new and current policies and regulations relating to the safety and security of the buildings and their occupants,” Jordan explained. “We also inform them of changes in policies or procedures and happenings around the center that affect the buildings and occupants, such as road closures or hurricanes.” Jordan and Palmer oversee Facility Manager training, as well. They provide bi-annual training for new facility managers and periodic forums with subject matter experts on topics relevant to the team’s responsibilities. \n\n“We are available to address any questions or concerns the facility managers may have regarding their role, buildings, or occupants,” she said. “We are the liaison and advocate for them with their organizations, my organization (which controls the program), the center, and our stakeholders.”\n\nJordan is also a facility engineer in the Center Operations Directorate’s Facilities Management and Operations Division. She joined Johnson’s team in 2008 after working for four years at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. She served as Johnson’s facility manager coordinator for seven years before becoming the lead in 2019.\n\n“I enjoy helping, meeting people, and developing relationships,” she said. “Even though I do a lot of routine work, there is something new to experience, deal with, or learn every day.” \n\nHelping and connecting with others is what Angel Olmedo enjoys most about being a facility manager. “There’s no greater sense of purpose than being the person people rely on to find the help or solutions they need to finish their day strong and productive,” he said. “I’ve learned new skills and had a chance to meet and interact with a lot more people than I did before.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAngel Olmedo\n\n\n\nOlmedo has worked at Johnson for nearly five years on the Human Space Flight Technical Integration Contract. In the spring of 2024, he was offered the opportunity to become the facility manager for buildings 4 south and 4 north, and the alternate facility manager for building 17. “During my first few years working here at Johnson, I enjoyed helping people get solutions to their technical problems – be they application related, access issues, or credentials,” he said. “I found that in becoming a facility manager I can continue to do something similar in a whole new way.”\n\nSid Dickerson has been the prime facility manager for building 17 and alternate for buildings 4 south and 4 north since November 2022. An IT specialist and property custodian at Johnson for more than 30 years, Dickerson takes pride in resolving issues quickly and efficiently and strives to maintain excellent customer feedback. “I want to be the best facility manager for my employer and customers as I help the facility achieve maintenance, cleaning, health and safety and scheduling goals,” he said. He added that working with a team of engineers, IT specialists, and maintenance staff to modernize the building 17 elevators was one of his favorite experiences to date.\n\n\n\n\n\nSiegfried Dickerson\nNASA/Robert Markowitz\n\n\n\nMichael Meadows – facility manager for buildings 10, 9 south, and 260 – was inspired to join the Johnson team while delivering newspapers onsite. An Alvin Community College student at the time, Meadows noticed a facility manager plaque on the wall of Johnson’s External Relations Office. “I knew that with hard work and dedication, I would one day become a Johnson employee and support flight and see my photo on that wall!”\n\nMeadows began working at Johnson in 1999 and has been a facility manager for 23 years. He received a Silver Snoopy Award in May 2011 in recognition of the support he provided to the International Space Station Program as the manager for Johnson’s manufacturing facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Meadows\nNASA/Robert Markowitz\n\n\n\nSome Johnson team members are hired specifically for a facility manager position. Others may volunteer or be appointed to the role by their organization’s management. Regardless of how they became a facility manager, each person must complete an initial and a refresher training covering topics such as hazard identification and mitigation, energy conservation, security, and legal considerations. Additional training may be required depending on building assignments. Once fully trained, facility managers may stay in that role as long as they work at Johnson.\n\nThe most rewarding part of being a facility manager, said Meadows, is “the feeling you get when you keep up with the facility and make that a great home for all the occupants every day.”  \n\nCurious about all of the roles available at NASA?

Vande Hei, who was the keynote speaker for Marshall’s Safety Day on Sept. 26. \nNASA/Krisdon Manecke\n\n\n\nNASA started the Safety Day tradition following the space shuttle Columbia accident in 2003. Centers across the agency dedicate a day each year for team members to pause and reflect on keeping the work environment safe. \nThis year’s Safety Day began with a breakfast for employees, which was sponsored by Jacobs and Bastion Technologies. After breakfast, Bill Hill, director of the Safety and Mission Assurance Directorate at Marshall, welcomed center team members before introducing Pelfrey.\n“Over the past year, Marshall’s leadership and workforce have highlighted that transparency is an essential cultural attribute of our workforce and center,” Pelfrey said. “It is also important to our core value of safety. Transparency fosters an environment where employees feel comfortable in reporting potential risks or safety concerns without fear of retribution. This openness ensures that issues are addressed early. It builds trust and accountability within our workforce, center, NASA, and external stakeholders.”\n\n\n\n\nNASA astronaut Mark T. Vande Hei talks about his time in space aboard the International Space Station. \nNASA/Krisdon Manecke\n\n\n\nGuest speaker Marceleus Venable, a purpose coach, trainer, and author, followed Pelfrey’s remarks, telling team members to be safe by taking care of their physical and mental health. He encouraged them to take the time to pat themselves on the back for all their hard work and to appreciate their fellow workers at Marshall.\nNASA astronaut Mark T. Vande Hei was the keynote speaker, encouraging employees to be team players in NASA’s safety mission.\n“We need a lot of talented team players to meet the challenges that we have for future space flights,” said Vande Hei, who was selected as a NASA astronaut in 2009 and most recently served as a flight engineer on the International Space Station as part of Expedition 65 and 66. “Always try to do your best, but make sure that other people around you are doing their best as well and help them do that rather than you standing out as always being the best.”\n\n\n\n\nPeter Wreschinsky, second from left, a Jacobs Space Exploration Group employee, is presented with the Golden Eagle Award during Safety Day. He is joined by his wife, Sheri. They are joined by Bill Hill, left, director of the Safety and Mission Assurance Directorate at Marshall, and Jeff Haars, right, Jacobs vice president. The Golden Eagle Award is a part of the Mission Success is in Our Hands initiative, a collaboration between Marshall and Jacobs. Wreschinsky was recognized with the award for voicing concern about a valve impacted by corrosion on the Commercial Crew Program Crew-8 Dragon Capsule.

Marshall leads the development of the systems needed to safely land humans on the Moon and, eventually Mars. This includes the Human Landing System Program (HLS), which manages the development of commercial lunar landing systems that will transport astronauts to and from the surface of the Moon as part of the agency’s Artemis campaign.\nFor Artemis III and Artemis IV, NASA has selected SpaceX’s Starship HLS, while Blue Origin’s Blue Moon lander will be used for Artemis V. Having two distinct lunar lander designs, with different approaches to how they meet NASA’s mission needs, provides more robustness while ensuring a regular cadence of Moon landings.\nNASA works closely with its industry partners to mature the landers, exercising insight and offering collaboration to ensure astronaut safety and mission success. Through Artemis, NASA aims to land the first woman, first person of color, and first international partner astronaut on the lunar surface while advancing key science and discovery for the benefit of all.\nLearn more about HLS and meet some of the NASA Marshall teammates below who are working on the lunar landers:\n\n\n\n\nAmy Buck\nNASA/Ken Hall\n\n\n\nAmy Buck has been working with Artemis systems since she first came to Marshall 10 years ago. Previously part of the cryogenic insulation team for the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket, Buck is now the materials discipline lead for HLS. In her role, she has the chance to work on nearly every piece of hardware for the two landers as she and her team work with each of the HLS providers to ensure compliance with NASA’s requirements.\n“The NASA HLS materials team is vital in supporting the design, testing, and manufacturing of the landers,” Buck said. “Landing on the Moon is central to the larger Artemis mission, and I’m super excited to be part of the Artemis Generation.”\nBuck is most excited to see the first woman land on the Moon under Artemis and says she hopes it will inspire young girls — the next generation of engineers and scientists — to go into science and engineering.\n\n\n\n\nSean Underwood\nNASA/Ken Hall\n\n\n\nMission success is all in the details for Sean Underwood, the thermal discipline lead for HLS. The Georgia native works with a team responsible for ensuring that the lunar landers can operate in the Moon’s harsh environment.\n“There are unique thermal challenges associated with the Artemis III, IV, and V missions,” Underwood said. “Our primary objective is to manage thermal energy and heating rates, ensuring that HLS components and systems remain within thermal limits across all mission environments.”\nUnderwood joined Marshall in 2020 and sees his role with Artemis as one that will shape the future of space exploration —and Marshall. “Marshall Space Flight Center has been at the forefront of monumental space projects since its inception,” he said. “Through Artemis, we are ensuring that the legacy of past missions continues to inspire and drive us forward.”\n› Back to Top\nInnovative Thermal Energy Storage Tanks Keep Marshall Cool — and Save Taxpayer Dollars\nBy Rick Smith\nAs any home or business owner in the Southern United States knows, maintaining energy costs while trying to keep cool in the sweltering summer months is no simple challenge.\nBut one “cool” new infrastructure upgrade at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center will reduce the center’s utility costs by approximately $250,000 a year, shrinking Marshall’s environmental footprint and streamlining long-term infrastructure maintenance costs.\n\n\n\n\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center facilities engineers Connor McLean, left, and Angela Bell assess the readiness of Marshall’s new thermal energy storage tank, which officially goes into operation in October. The tank stands alongside Marshall’s original thermal tank outside Building 4473, where they chill and store water to cool off laboratories, offices, and other buildings during the hot summer months. McLean and Bell lead the tank project on behalf of Marshall’s Office of Center Operations. \nNASA/Charles Beason\n\n\n\nIt’s called a thermal energy storage tank — 60 feet high, 60 feet in diameter, each unit capable of holding approximately 1.125 million gallons of chilled water — and it represents another milestone for facilities engineers in Marshall’s Office of Center Operations, whose tactics have already reduced center-wide energy expenditure by a dizzying 58.3% since fiscal year 2003.\nThermal energy storage is not a new process; it’s been used for decades to maximize efficiency in temperature control, particularly among industrial facilities and large public venues from hospitals to indoor stadiums. At Marshall, the chilled water serves a critical purpose center-wide, circulating from a central plant via a network of underground pipes to help keep laboratories and other buildings temperate throughout the summer heat.\n“The average team member might not realize it’s chilled water, not just air, that keeps our labs, offices, and test facilities cool,” said Marshall facilities engineer Angela Bell, who helped oversee the installation of the second tank. “Our tanks operate at night, when utility prices drop and there is less overall demand on the regional energy grid, then send the chillwater out during the day.”\nMarshall’s first tank was built and put into operation in 2008-2009. The second officially goes into service in October, joining its counterpart in creating chilled water overnight. Together, the tanks — situated adjacent to Building 4473 on the corner of Morris and Titan roads —provide an annual energy savings of roughly half a million dollars.\nMarshall facilities engineer Connor McLean, who succeeded Bell as project manager for the new tank, noted that each thermal energy storage tank handles approximately 106,000 kilo-BTUs worth of cooling activity per day — or roughly 1,750 times as much cooling capacity as a central air system in a traditional family home.\nEven with that considerable output, Marshall’s original tank had been hard-pressed to keep up with demand across the entire center over the past decade and a half, as climate change steadily pushed temperatures to sustained extremes.\n“This is a huge stride in critical system redundancy,” McLean said. “Having the second tank enables us to run both concurrently or give one of them some necessary downtime without loss of center-wide functionality. That added capability makes Marshall more resilient and bolsters our confidence in our ability to handle unforeseen challenges.”\nThe electricity that powers the storage tanks is a mix —hydroelectric, fossil fuels, nuclear, and an increasing amount of renewable energy sources —provided by the Tennessee Valley Authority via the U.S. Army, from whom NASA leases property on Redstone Arsenal. \n“The tanks will be tremendous cost-savers for the next 40-50 years,” Bell said. “They allow us to use energy much more efficiently, based on past energy consumption levels —and that allows Marshall to do other things with those dollars.”\nOver the past 20 years, Marshall has reinvested energy savings and facilities cost underruns back into center operations, often to fund new, cost-saving overhauls: upgrading facility HVAC systems or replacing obsolete lighting with more efficient LEDs.\n“If we didn’t reduce consumption, our projected utility costs would be around $30 million per year,” said Rhonda Truitt, Marshall’s energy and water manager. “Thanks to efficient strategizing, encouraged and championed by Marshall and NASA leadership, we typically operate in the range of just $16-18 million per year.”\nSuch strategies have enabled Marshall to effectively keep its infrastructure budget flat since the early 2010s — reducing overall energy consumption and replacing outdated facilities with more cost-conscious, environmentally friendly modern buildings, a program known among facilities engineers as “repair by replacement.”\nThe U.S. Army at Redstone doesn’t employ a central chiller plant of its own, but the Marshall facilities team works “very closely” with their counterparts on the military side.\n“We have a great working relationship,” Truitt said. “The real advantage of our system is that by reducing our peak energy demand, it reduces it for all of Redstone —which benefits the rest of the Arsenal and the lower Tennessee Valley.”\nThe new tank goes into operation just in time for the start of National Energy Awareness Month in October —and Truitt and her team encourage the Marshall workforce to continue to practice sensible energy conservation tactics even as sweat-inducing temperatures subside.\n“Turn off lights and computer monitors wherever possible, don’t leave doors or windows propped open, and be mindful of all the small things that can add up over time,” Truitt said. “Our goal is always to help team members do their jobs in the most efficient way possible, to accomplish Marshall’s objectives and conserve our energy budget without impeding the mission.”\nThanks to the center’s new thermal energy storage tank, that should be no sweat.\nSmith, an Aeyon employee, supports the Marshall Office of Communications.\n› Back to Top\nMarshall Welcomes Members of the NASA Advisory Council\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRae Ann Meyer, front right, deputy director of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, is joined by members of the NASA Advisory Council and NASA Headquarters staff Oct. 1 at Marshall.

While previous efforts focused on the reduction of trash mass and volume, this challenge will prioritize technologies for recycling waste into usable products needed for off-planet science and exploration activities.  \n\n\n\n\n\nNASA’s LunaRecycle Challenge will incentivize the design and development of energy-efficient, low-mass, and low-impact recycling solutions that address physical waste streams and improve the sustainability of longer-duration lunar missions. Through the power of open innovation, which draws on the public’s ingenuity and creativity to find solutions, NASA can restructure the agency’s approach to waste management, support the future of space travel, and revolutionize waste treatments on Earth, leading to greater sustainability on our home planet and beyond. \n“Operating sustainably is an important consideration for NASA as we make discoveries and conduct research both away from home and on Earth,” said Amy Kaminski, program executive for NASA’s Prizes, Challenges, and Crowdsourcing program. “With this challenge, we are seeking the public’s innovative approaches to waste management on the Moon and aim to take lessons learned back to Earth for the benefit of all.” \nNASA’s LunaRecycle Challenge will offer two competition tracks: a Prototype Build track and a Digital Twin track. The Prototype Build Track focuses on designing and developing hardware components and systems for recycling one or more solid waste streams on the lunar surface. The Digital Twin Track focuses on designing a virtual replica of a complete system for recycling solid waste streams on the lunar surface and manufacturing end products. Offering a Digital Twin track further lowers the barrier of entry for global solvers to participate in NASA Centennial Challenges and contribute to agency missions and initiatives.  \nTeams will have the opportunity to compete in either or both competition tracks, each of which will carry its own share of the prize purse. \nThe LunaRecycle Challenge also will address some of the aerospace community’s top technical challenges. In July, NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate released a ranked list of 187 technology areas requiring further development to meet future exploration, science, and other mission needs. The results integrated inputs from NASA mission directorates and centers, industry organizations, government agencies, academia, and other interested individuals to help guide NASA’s space technology development and investments. This list and subsequent updates will help inform future Centennial Challenges.  \nThe three technological needs that LunaRecycle will address include logistics tracking, clothing, and trash management for habitation; in-space and on-surface manufacturing of parts and products; and in-space and on-surface manufacturing from recycled and reused materials. \n“I am pleased that NASA’s LunaRecycle Challenge will contribute to solutions pertaining to technological needs within advanced manufacturing and habitats,” said Kim Krome, acting program manager for agency’s Centennial Challenges, and challenge manager of LunaRecycle. “We are very excited to see what solutions our global competitors generate, and we are eager for this challenge to serve as a positive catalyst for bringing the agency, and humanity, closer to exploring worlds beyond our own.” \nNASA has contracted The University of Alabama to be the allied partner for the duration of the challenge. The university, based in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, will coordinate with former Centennial Challenge winner AI Spacefactory to facilitate the challenge and manage its competitors.  \nTo register as a participant in NASA’s LunaRecycle Challenge, visit: lunarecyclechallenge.ua.edu. \nNASA’s LunaRecycle Challenge is led by the agency’s Kennedy Space Center with support from Marshall Space Flight Center.

Marshall leads the development of the systems needed to safely land humans on the Moon and, eventually Mars. This includes the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/human-landing-system/\">Human Landing System Program</a> (HLS), which manages the development of commercial lunar landing systems that will transport astronauts to and from the surface of the Moon as part of the agency’s Artemis campaign.</p>\n<p>For Artemis III and Artemis IV, NASA has selected SpaceX’s Starship HLS, while Blue Origin’s Blue Moon lander will be used for Artemis V. Having two distinct lunar lander designs, with different approaches to how they meet NASA’s mission needs, provides more robustness while ensuring a regular cadence of Moon landings.</p>\n<p>NASA works closely with its industry partners to mature the landers, exercising insight and offering collaboration to ensure astronaut safety and mission success. Through Artemis, NASA aims to land the first woman, first person of color, and first international partner astronaut on the lunar surface while advancing key science and discovery for the benefit of all.</p>\n<p>Learn more about HLS and meet some of the NASA Marshall teammates below who are working on the lunar landers:</p>\n<div class=\"hds-media hds-module wp-block-image\" id=\"\">\n<div class=\"margin-left-auto margin-right-auto nasa-block-align-inline\">\n<div class=\"hds-media-wrapper margin-left-auto margin-right-auto\">\n<figure class=\"hds-media-inner hds-cover-wrapper hds-media-ratio-fit \"><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/amy-buck.jpg\"><img style=\"transform: scale(1); transform-origin: 50% 50%; object-position: 50% 50%; object-fit: cover;\" block_context=\"nasa-block\" width=\"2048\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/amy-buck.jpg 3028w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/amy-buck.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/amy-buck.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/amy-buck.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/amy-buck.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/amy-buck.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/amy-buck.jpg?resize=400,267 400w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/amy-buck.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/amy-buck.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/amy-buck.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/amy-buck.jpg?resize=2000,1334 2000w\" height=\"1366\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" src=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/amy-buck.jpg?w=2048\" class=\"attachment-2048x2048 size-2048x2048\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Amy Buck\"></a></figure><figcaption class=\"hds-caption padding-y-2\">\n<div class=\"hds-caption-text p-sm margin-0\">Amy Buck</div>\n<div class=\"hds-credits\">NASA/Ken Hall</div>\n</figcaption></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Amy Buck has been working with Artemis systems since she first came to Marshall 10 years ago.

McLean and Bell lead the tank project on behalf of Marshall’s Office of Center Operations. </div>\n<div class=\"hds-credits\">NASA/Charles Beason</div>\n</figcaption></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>It’s called a thermal energy storage tank — 60 feet high, 60 feet in diameter, each unit capable of holding approximately 1.125 million gallons of chilled water — and it represents another milestone for facilities engineers in Marshall’s Office of Center Operations, whose tactics have already reduced center-wide energy expenditure by a dizzying 58.3% since fiscal year 2003.</p>\n<p>Thermal energy storage is not a new process; it’s been used for decades to maximize efficiency in temperature control, particularly among industrial facilities and large public venues from hospitals to indoor stadiums. At Marshall, the chilled water serves a critical purpose center-wide, circulating from a central plant via a network of underground pipes to help keep laboratories and other buildings temperate throughout the summer heat.</p>\n<p>“The average team member might not realize it’s chilled water, not just air, that keeps our labs, offices, and test facilities cool,” said Marshall facilities engineer Angela Bell, who helped oversee the installation of the second tank. “Our tanks operate at night, when utility prices drop and there is less overall demand on the regional energy grid, then send the chillwater out during the day.”</p>\n<p>Marshall’s first tank was built and put into operation in 2008-2009. The second officially goes into service in October, joining its counterpart in creating chilled water overnight. Together, the tanks — situated adjacent to Building 4473 on the corner of Morris and Titan roads —provide an annual energy savings of roughly half a million dollars.</p>\n<p>Marshall facilities engineer Connor McLean, who succeeded Bell as project manager for the new tank, noted that each thermal energy storage tank handles approximately 106,000 kilo-BTUs worth of cooling activity per day — or roughly 1,750 times as much cooling capacity as a central air system in a traditional family home.</p>\n<p>Even with that considerable output, Marshall’s original tank had been hard-pressed to keep up with demand across the entire center over the past decade and a half, as climate change steadily pushed temperatures to sustained extremes.</p>\n<p>“This is a huge stride in critical system redundancy,” McLean said. “Having the second tank enables us to run both concurrently or give one of them some necessary downtime without loss of center-wide functionality. That added capability makes Marshall more resilient and bolsters our confidence in our ability to handle unforeseen challenges.”</p>\n<p>The electricity that powers the storage tanks is a mix —hydroelectric, fossil fuels, nuclear, and an increasing amount of renewable energy sources —provided by the Tennessee Valley Authority via the U.S. Army, from whom NASA leases property on Redstone Arsenal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The tanks will be tremendous cost-savers for the next 40-50 years,” Bell said. “They allow us to use energy much more efficiently, based on past energy consumption levels —and that allows Marshall to do other things with those dollars.”</p>\n<p>Over the past 20 years, Marshall has reinvested energy savings and facilities cost underruns back into center operations, often to fund new, cost-saving overhauls: upgrading facility HVAC systems or replacing obsolete lighting with more efficient LEDs.</p>\n<p>“If we didn’t reduce consumption, our projected utility costs would be around $30 million per year,” said Rhonda Truitt, Marshall’s energy and water manager. “Thanks to efficient strategizing, encouraged and championed by Marshall and NASA leadership, we typically operate in the range of just $16-18 million per year.”</p>\n<p>Such strategies have enabled Marshall to effectively keep its infrastructure budget flat since the early 2010s — reducing overall energy consumption and replacing outdated facilities with more cost-conscious, environmentally friendly modern buildings, a program known among facilities engineers as “repair by replacement.”</p>\n<p>The U.S. Army at Redstone doesn’t employ a central chiller plant of its own, but the Marshall facilities team works “very closely” with their counterparts on the military side.</p>\n<p>“We have a great working relationship,” Truitt said. “The real advantage of our system is that by reducing our peak energy demand, it reduces it for all of Redstone —which benefits the rest of the Arsenal and the lower Tennessee Valley.”</p>\n<p>The new tank goes into operation just in time for the start of National Energy Awareness Month in October —and Truitt and her team encourage the Marshall workforce to continue to practice sensible energy conservation tactics even as sweat-inducing temperatures subside.</p>\n<p>“Turn off lights and computer monitors wherever possible, don’t leave doors or windows propped open, and be mindful of all the small things that can add up over time,” Truitt said. “Our goal is always to help team members do their jobs in the most efficient way possible, to accomplish Marshall’s objectives and conserve our energy budget without impeding the mission.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to the center’s new thermal energy storage tank, that should be no sweat.</p>\n<p><em>Smith, an Aeyon employee, supports the Marshall Office of Communications.</em></p>\n<p><strong><strong><a data-type=\"internal\" data-id=\"#top\" href=\"#top\">› Back to Top</a></strong></strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"heading-36 hds-reference-section-heading\" id=\"hds-sidebar-nav-4\">Marshall Welcomes Members of the NASA Advisory Council</h2>\n<div id=\"\" class=\"hds-media hds-module wp-block-image\">\n<div class=\"margin-left-auto margin-right-auto nasa-block-align-inline\">\n<div class=\"hds-media-wrapper margin-left-auto margin-right-auto\">\n<figure class=\"hds-media-inner hds-cover-wrapper hds-media-ratio-fit \"><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ceb-1332.jpg\"><img width=\"2048\" block_context=\"nasa-block\" height=\"1638\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"transform: scale(1); transform-origin: 50% 50%; object-position: 50% 50%; object-fit: cover;\" class=\"attachment-2048x2048 size-2048x2048\" src=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ceb-1332.jpg?w=2048\" alt=\"Rae Ann Meyer, front right, deputy director of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, is joined by members of the NASA Advisory Council and NASA Headquarters staff Oct. 1 at Marshall.

While previous efforts focused on the reduction of trash mass and volume, this challenge will prioritize technologies for recycling waste into usable products needed for off-planet science and exploration activities. &nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lIVRhsEmKAo?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"NASA Seeks Innovators for $3 Million Lunar Waste Competition\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>NASA’s LunaRecycle Challenge will incentivize the design and development of energy-efficient, low-mass, and low-impact recycling solutions that address physical waste streams and improve the sustainability of longer-duration lunar missions. Through the power of open innovation, which draws on the public’s ingenuity and creativity to find solutions, NASA can restructure the agency’s approach to waste management, support the future of space travel, and revolutionize waste treatments on Earth, leading to greater sustainability on our home planet and beyond.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Operating sustainably is an important consideration for NASA as we make discoveries and conduct research both away from home and on Earth,” said Amy Kaminski, program executive for NASA’s Prizes, Challenges, and Crowdsourcing program. “With this challenge, we are seeking the public’s innovative approaches to waste management on the Moon and aim to take lessons learned back to Earth for the benefit of all.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NASA’s LunaRecycle Challenge will offer two competition tracks: a Prototype Build track and a Digital Twin track. The Prototype Build Track focuses on designing and developing hardware components and systems for recycling one or more solid waste streams on the lunar surface. The Digital Twin Track focuses on designing a virtual replica of a complete system for recycling solid waste streams on the lunar surface and manufacturing end products. Offering a Digital Twin track further lowers the barrier of entry for global solvers to participate in&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/prizes-challenges-and-crowdsourcing/centennial-challenges/\">NASA Centennial Challenges</a>&nbsp;and contribute to agency missions and initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Teams will have the opportunity to compete in either or both competition tracks, each of which will carry its own share of the prize purse.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The LunaRecycle Challenge also will address some of the aerospace community’s top technical challenges. In July, NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate released a ranked list of 187 technology areas requiring further development to meet future exploration, science, and other mission needs. The results integrated inputs from NASA mission directorates and centers, industry organizations, government agencies, academia, and other interested individuals to help guide NASA’s space technology development and investments. This list and subsequent updates will help inform future Centennial Challenges. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The three technological needs that LunaRecycle will address include logistics tracking, clothing, and trash management for habitation; in-space and on-surface manufacturing of parts and products; and in-space and on-surface manufacturing from recycled and reused materials.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I am pleased that NASA’s LunaRecycle Challenge will contribute to solutions pertaining to technological needs within advanced manufacturing and habitats,” said Kim Krome, acting program manager for agency’s Centennial Challenges, and challenge manager of LunaRecycle. “We are very excited to see what solutions our global competitors generate, and we are eager for this challenge to serve as a positive catalyst for bringing the agency, and humanity, closer to exploring worlds beyond our own.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NASA has contracted The University of Alabama to be the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/static/saa/domestic/40962_40962_Univ_of_AL_Final_Signed.pdf?emrc=66fee2999ce54\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">allied partner</a>&nbsp;for the duration of the challenge.

The test unit will employ a flexible architecture to simulate and evaluate different rover concepts for use beginning with Artemis V.\nIn April 2024, as part of the Lunar Terrain Vehicle Services contract, NASA selected three vendors — Intuitive Machines, Lunar Outpost, and Venturi Astrolab — to supply rover capabilities for use by astronauts on the lunar surface. While the test unit will never go to the Moon, it will support the development of additional rover prototypes that will enable NASA and the three companies to continue making progress until one of the providers comes online. Additionally, data provided from GTU testing helps inform both NASA and the commercial companies as they continue evolving their rover designs as it serves as an engineering testbed for the LTV providers to test their technologies on crew compartment design, rover maintenance, and payload science integration, to name a few.\n“The Ground Test Unit will help NASA teams on the ground, test and understand all aspects of rover operations on the lunar surface ahead of Artemis missions,” said Jeff Somers, engineering lead for the Ground Test Unit. “The GTU allows NASA to be a smart buyer, so we are able to test and evaluate rover operations while we work with the LTVS contractors and their hardware.” \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSuited NASA engineers sit on the rover prototype during testing at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.NASA/Bill Stafford\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA suited NASA engineer sits on the agency’s rover prototype during testing at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.NASA/Bill Stafford\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSuited NASA engineers sit on the rover prototype during testing at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.NASA/Bill Stafford\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nThe LTVS contractors have requirements that align with the existing GTU capabilities. As with the test unit, the vendor-developed, LTV should support up to two crewmembers, have the ability to be operated remotely, and can implement multiple control concepts such as drive modes, self-leveling, and supervised autonomy. Having a NASA prototype of the vehicle we will drive on the Moon, here on Earth, allows many teams to test capabilities while also getting hands-on engineering experience developing rover hardware.\n\n\n\nNASA has built some next generation rover concept vehicles following the successes of the agency’s Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle in the 1970s, including this iteration of the GTU. Crewed test vehicles here on Earth like the GTU help NASA learn new ways that astronauts can live and work safely and productively on the Moon, and one day on the surface of Mars.

While the test unit will never go to the Moon, it will support the development of additional rover prototypes that will enable NASA and the three companies to continue making progress until one of the providers comes online.

Credit: Oscar van der VeldeThere’s more to thunderclouds than rain and lightning. Along with visible light emissions, thunderclouds can produce intense bursts of gamma rays, the most energetic form of light, that last for millionths of a second. The clouds can also glow steadily with gamma rays for seconds to minutes at a time.Researchers using NASA airborne platforms have now found a new kind of gamma-ray emission that’s shorter in duration than the steady glows and longer than the microsecond bursts. They’re calling it a flickering gamma-ray flash. The discovery fills in a missing link in scientists’ understanding of thundercloud radiation and provides new insights into the mechanisms that produce lightning. The insights, in turn, could lead to more accurate lightning risk estimates for people, aircraft, and spacecraft.Researchers from the University of Bergen in Norway led the study in collaboration with scientists from NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and multiple universities in the U.S., Mexico, Colombia, and Europe. The findings were described in a pair of papers in Nature, published Oct. 2.The international research team made their discovery while flying a battery of detectors aboard a NASA ER-2 research aircraft. In July 2023, the ER-2 set out on a series of 10 flights from MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. The plane flew figure-eight flight patterns a few miles above tropical thunderclouds in the Caribbean and Central America, providing unprecedented views of cloud activity.The scientific payload was developed for the Airborne Lightning Observatory for Fly’s Eye Geostationary Lightning Mapper Simulator and Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (ALOFT) campaign. Instrumentation in the payload included weather radars along with multiple sensors for measuring gamma rays, lightning flashes, and microwave emissions from clouds. The researchers had hoped ALOFT instruments would observe fast radiation bursts known as terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs). The flashes, first discovered in 1992 by NASA’s Compton Gamma Ray Observatory spacecraft, accompany some lightning strikes and last only millionths of a second. Despite their high intensity and their association with visible lightning, few TGFs have been spotted during previous aircraft-based studies.  “I went to a meeting just before the ALOFT campaign,” said principal investigator Nikolai Østgaard, a space physicist with the University of Bergen. “And they asked me: ‘How many TGFs are you going to see?’ I said: ‘Either we’ll see zero, or we’ll see a lot.’ And then we happened to see 130.” However, the flickering gamma-ray flashes were a complete surprise.“They’re almost impossible to detect from space,” said co-principal investigator Martino Marisaldi, who is also a University of Bergen space physicist. “But when you are flying at 20 kilometers [12.5 miles] high, you're so close that you will see them.” The research team found more than 25 of these new flashes, each lasting between 50 to 200 milliseconds. The abundance of fast bursts and the discovery of intermediate-duration flashes could be among the most important thundercloud discoveries in a decade or more, said University of New Hampshire physicist Joseph Dwyer, who was not involved in the research. “They’re telling us something about how thunderstorms work, which is really important because thunderstorms produce lightning that hurts and kills a lot of people.” More broadly, Dwyer said he is excited about the prospects of advancing the field of meteorology. “I think everyone assumes that we figured out lightning a long time ago, but it’s an overlooked area … we don’t understand what’s going on inside those clouds right over our heads.” The discovery of flickering gamma-ray flashes may provide crucial clues scientists need to understand thundercloud dynamics, he said.Turning to aircraft-based instrumentation rather than satellites ensured a lot of bang for research bucks, said the study’s project scientist, Timothy Lang of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. “If we had gotten one flash, we would have been ecstatic — and we got well over 100,” he said. This research could lead to a significant advance in our understanding of thunderstorms and radiation from thunderstorms. “It shows that if you have the right problem and you're willing to take a little bit of risk, you can have a huge payoff.”By James RiordonNASA’s Earth Science News Team","html":"<div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div

Time will tell if it's the brightest of the year, once it appears in twilight after about October 14.Skywatching HighlightsAll month – Planet visibility report: Look for Venus low in the west just after sunset; Saturn can be seen toward the southeast as soon as it gets dark; Mars rises around midnight; and Jupiter rises in the first half of the night (rising earlier as the month goes on).October 2 – New moonOctober 11 – Europa is easily observable to one side of Jupiter by itself this morning using binoculars.October 14-31 – Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) becomes visible low in the west following sunset. If the comet's tail is well-illuminated by sunlight, it could be visible to the unaided eye. The first week and a half (Oct. 14-24) is the best time to observe, using binoculars or a small telescope.October 13-14 – After dark both nights, look for the nearly full Moon with Saturn toward the southeast.October 17 – Full moonOctober 20 – The Moon rises near Jupiter, with the giant planet looking extremely bright. You should be able to find them low in the east after around 10 pm.October 23-24 – Early risers will be able to spot Mars together with the Moon, high overhead in the south both mornings.October 25 – Europa is easily observable to one side of Jupiter by itself this morning using binoculars.TranscriptWhat's Up for October? This month's viewing tips for Venus, Saturn, Mars and Jupiter. When's the best time to observe the destination of NASA's next deep space mission? And how you can see a (potentially bright) comet this month? And watch our video 'till the end for photos of highlights from last month’s skies.Sky chart showing Mars near the Moon on October 23. The pair appear quite high overhead, along with Jupiter.NASA/JPL-CaltechUp first, we look at the visibility of the planets in October. Look for Venus low in the west just after sunset. It's setting by the time the sky is fully dark. Saturn is visible toward the southeast as soon as it gets dark out, and sets by dawn. Mars rises around midnight all month. By dawn it has climbed quite high into the south-southeastern sky, appearing together with Jupiter. Now, Jupiter is rising in the first half of the night. In early October you'll find it high in the south as dawn approaches, and later in the month it's progressed farther over to the west before sunrise.And, speaking of Jupiter, NASA plans to launch its latest solar system exploration mission to one of the giant planet's moons this month. Europa Clipper is slated to blast off as early as October 10th. It's thought that Europa holds an enormous ocean of salty liquid water beneath its icy surface. That makes this the first mission dedicated to studying an ocean world beyond Earth. Europa Clipper is designed to help us understand whether this icy moon could support some form of life, and along the way it'll teach us more about the conditions that make a world habitable.Now, if you've ever pointed binoculars or a telescope at Jupiter, you know the thrill of seeing the little star-like points of light next to it that are its four large moons, which were first observed by Galileo in 1610.There are two mornings in October, the 11th and the 25th, when you can most easily observe Europa. These are times when the moon is at its greatest separation from the planet as seen from here on Earth, and it's all by itself to one side of Jupiter. So be sure to have your own peek at Jupiter's moon Europa this month, as a new NASA mission begins its journey to explore an ocean in the sky.Now a look at Moon and planet pair-ups for October. On the 13th and 14th after dark, look for the nearly full Moon with Saturn toward the southeast. Then on the evening of October 20th, the Moon rises near Jupiter, with the giant planet looking extremely bright.You should be able to find them low in the east after around 10 pm that night. Then, in the morning of Oct. 23rd and 24th, early risers will be able to spot Mars together with the Moon, high overhead in the south.Sky chart showing the location of Comet C/2023 A3 between Oct. 14 and Oct 24 following sunset. The comet climbs higher each evening, but also grows fainter. NASA/JPL-CaltechOctober offers a chance to observe what could be the brightest comet of the year. Earlier this year we got a look at Comet 12P, which was visible with binoculars but not super bright. Now another of these ancient and icy dust balls is streaking through our neighborhood on an 80,000-year orbit from the distant reaches of the Oort Cloud. The comet, known as C/2023 A3, aka Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, is currently speeding through the inner solar system. It passed its closest to the Sun in late September, and will be at its closest to Earth on October 13th. And after that time, through the end of the month, will be the best time to look for it. This is when the comet will become visible low in the western sky beginning during twilight.It will quickly rise higher each subsequent evening, making it easier to observe, but it'll also be getting a little fainter each night. As with all comets, predictions for how bright it could get are uncertain. If the comet's tail is brilliantly illuminated by the Sun, predictions show that it could become bright enough to see with the unaided eye. But comets have a way of surprising us, so we'll just have to wait and see.Your best shot at seeing it will be from around October 14th through the 24th, with binoculars or a small telescope, and a reasonably clear view toward the west. So good luck, and clear skies, comet hunters!Watch our video for views of what some of the highlights we told you about in last month's video actually looked like.The phases of the Moon for October 2024.NASA/JPL-CaltechAnd here are the phases of the Moon for October.

Earlier this year we got a look at Comet 12P, which was visible with binoculars but not super bright. Now another of these ancient and icy dust balls is streaking through our neighborhood on an 80,000-year orbit from the distant reaches of the Oort Cloud. The comet, known as C/2023 A3, aka Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, is currently speeding through the inner solar system. It passed its closest to the Sun in late September, and will be at its closest to Earth on October 13th. And after that time, through the end of the month, will be the best time to look for it.

As with all comets, predictions for how bright it could get are uncertain.

The discovery smashes the record for shortest outer orbital period for this type of system, set in 1956, which had a third star orbiting an inner pair in 33 days.\n“Thanks to the compact, edge-on configuration of the system, we can measure the orbits, masses, sizes, and temperatures of its stars,” said Veselin Kostov, a research scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California. “And we can study how the system formed and predict how it may evolve.”\nA paper, led by Kostov, describing the results was published in The Astrophysical Journal Oct. 2.\n\n\n\n\nThis artist’s concept illustrates how tightly the three stars in the system called TIC 290061484 orbit each other. If they were placed at the center of our solar system, all the stars’ orbits would be contained a space smaller than Mercury’s orbit around the Sun. The sizes of the triplet stars and the Sun are also to scale.\nNASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center\n\n\n\nFlickers in starlight helped reveal the tight trio, which is located in the constellation Cygnus. The system happens to be almost flat from our perspective. This means the stars each cross right in front of, or eclipse, each other as they orbit. When that happens, the nearer star blocks some of the farther star’s light.\nUsing machine learning, scientists filtered through enormous sets of starlight data from TESS to identify patterns of dimming that reveal eclipses. Then, a small team of citizen scientists filtered further, relying on years of experience and informal training to find particularly interesting cases.\nThese amateur astronomers, who are co-authors on the new study, met as participants in an online citizen science project called Planet Hunters, which was active from 2010 to 2013. The volunteers later teamed up with professional astronomers to create a new collaboration called the Visual Survey Group, which has been active for over a decade.\n“We’re mainly looking for signatures of compact multi-star systems, unusual pulsating stars in binary systems, and weird objects,” said Saul Rappaport, an emeritus professor of physics at MIT in Cambridge. Rappaport co-authored the paper and has helped lead the Visual Survey Group for more than a decade. “It’s exciting to identify a system like this because they’re rarely found, but they may be more common than current tallies suggest.” Many more likely speckle our galaxy, waiting to be discovered.\nPartly because the stars in the newfound system orbit in nearly the same plane, scientists say it’s likely very stable despite their tight configuration (the trio’s orbits fit within a smaller area than Mercury’s orbit around the Sun). Each star’s gravity doesn’t perturb the others too much, like they could if their orbits were tilted in different directions.\nBut while their orbits will likely remain stable for millions of years, “no one lives here,” Rappaport said. “We think the stars formed together from the same growth process, which would have disrupted planets from forming very closely around any of the stars.” The exception could be a distant planet orbiting the three stars as if they were one.\nAs the inner stars age, they will expand and ultimately merge, triggering a supernova explosion in around 20 to 40 million years.\nIn the meantime, astronomers are hunting for triple stars with even shorter orbits. That’s hard to do with current technology, but a new tool is on the way.\n\n\n\n\nThis graphic highlights the search areas of three transit-spotting missions: NASA’s upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, TESS (the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite), and the retired Kepler Space Telescope. Kepler found 13 triply eclipsing triple star systems, TESS has found more than 100 so far, and astronomers expect Roman to find more than 1,000.\nNASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center\n\n\n\nImages from NASA’s upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will be much more detailed than TESS’s. The same area of the sky covered by a single TESS pixel will fit more than 36,000 Roman pixels. And while TESS took a wide, shallow look at the entire sky, Roman will pierce deep into the heart of our galaxy where stars crowd together, providing a core sample rather than skimming the whole surface.\n“We don’t know much about a lot of the stars in the center of the galaxy except for the brightest ones,” said Brian Powell, a co-author and data scientist at Goddard. “Roman’s high-resolution view will help us measure light from stars that usually blur together, providing the best look yet at the nature of star systems in our galaxy.”\nAnd since Roman will monitor light from hundreds of millions of stars as part of one of its main surveys, it will help astronomers find more triple star systems in which all the stars eclipse each other.\n“We’re curious why we haven’t found star systems like these with even shorter outer orbital periods,” said Powell. “Roman should help us find them and bring us closer to figuring out what their limits might be.”\nRoman could also find eclipsing stars bound together in even larger groups — half a dozen, or perhaps even more all orbiting each other like bees buzzing around a hive.\n“Before scientists discovered triply eclipsing triple star systems, we didn’t expect them to be out there,” said co-author Tamás Borkovits, a senior research fellow at the Baja Observatory of The University of Szeged in Hungary. “But once we found them, we thought, well why not?

NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has mapped the gases spewing from one of these objects, suggesting a varied composition and providing new insights into the formation and evolution of the solar system.Centaurs are former trans-Neptunian objects that have been moved inside Neptune’s orbit by subtle gravitational influences of the planets in the last few million years, and may eventually become short-period comets. They are “hybrid” in the sense that they are in a transitional stage of their orbital evolution: Many share characteristics with both trans-Neptunian objects (from the cold Kuiper Belt reservoir), and short-period comets, which are objects highly altered by repeated close passages around the Sun.Image A: IllustrationSince these small icy bodies are in an orbital transitional phase, they have been the subject of various studies as scientists seek to understand their composition, the reasons behind their outgassing activity — the loss of their ices that lie underneath the surface — and how they serve as a link between primordial icy bodies in the outer solar system and evolved comets.A team of scientists recently used Webb’s NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) instrument to obtain data on Centaur 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 (29P for short), an object that is known for its highly active and quasi-periodic outbursts. It varies in intensity every six to eight weeks, making it one of the most active objects in the outer solar system. They discovered a new jet of carbon monoxide (CO) and previously unseen jets of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, which give new clues to the nature of the centaur’s nucleus.“Centaurs can be considered as some of the leftovers of our planetary system’s formation. Because they are stored at very cold temperatures, they preserve information about volatiles in the early stages of the solar system,” said Sara Faggi of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and American University in Washington, DC, lead author of the study. “Webb really opened the door to a resolution and sensitivity that was impressive to us — when we saw the data for the first time, we were excited. We had never seen anything like this.”Webb and the JetsCentaurs’ distant orbits and consequent faintness have inhibited detailed observations in the past. Data from prior radio wavelength observations of Centaur 29P showed a jet pointed generally toward the Sun (and Earth) composed of CO. Webb detected this face-on jet and, thanks to its large mirror and infrared capabilities, also sensitively searched for many other chemicals, including water (H2O) and CO2. The latter is one of the main forms in which carbon is stored across the solar system. No indication of water vapor was detected in the atmosphere of 29P, which could be related to the extremely cold temperatures present in this body.The telescope’s unique imaging and spectral data revealed never-before-seen features: two jets of CO2 emanating in the north and south directions, and another jet of CO pointing toward the north. This was the first definitive detection of CO2 in Centaur 29P.Image B: IFU GraphicBased on the data gathered by Webb, the team created a 3D model of the jets to understand their orientation and origin. They found through their modeling efforts that the jets were emitted from different regions on the centaur’s nucleus, even though the nucleus itself cannot be resolved by Webb. The jets’ angles suggest the possibility that the nucleus may be an aggregate of distinct objects with different compositions; however, other scenarios can’t yet be excluded.Video A: Zoom and SpinAn artist’s concept of Centaur 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1’s outgassing activity as seen from the side. While prior radio-wavelength observations showed a jet of gas pointed toward Earth, astronomers used NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to gather additional insight on the front jet’s composition and noted three more jets of gas spewing from Centaur 29P’s surface.Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, L. Hustak (STScI)“The fact that Centaur 29P has such dramatic differences in the abundance of CO and CO2 across its surface suggests that 29P may be made of several pieces,” said Geronimo Villanueva, co-author of the study at NASA Goddard. “Maybe two pieces coalesced together and made this centaur, which is a mixture between very different bodies that underwent separate formation pathways. It challenges our ideas about how primordial objects are created and stored in the Kuiper Belt.”Persisting Unanswered Questions (For Now)The reasons for Centaur 29P’s bursts in brightness, and the mechanisms behind its outgassing activity through the CO and CO2 jets, continue to be two major areas of interest that require further investigation.In the case of comets, scientists know that their jets are often driven by the outgassing of water. However, because of the centaurs’ location, they are too cold for water ice to sublimate, meaning that the nature of their outgassing activity differs from comets.“We only had time to look at this object once, like a snapshot in time,” said Adam McKay, a co-author of the study at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina. “I’d like to go back and look at Centaur 29P over a much longer period of time. Do the jets always have that orientation? Is there perhaps another carbon monoxide jet that turns on at a different point in the rotation period? Looking at these jets over time would give us much better insights into what is driving these outbursts.”The team is hopeful that as they increase their understanding of Centaur 29P, they can apply the same techniques to other centaurs. By improving the astronomical community’s collective knowledge of centaurs, we can simultaneously better our understanding on the formation and evolution of our solar system.These findings have been published in Nature.The observations were taken as part of General Observer program 2416.The James Webb Space Telescope is the world’s premier space science observatory. Webb is solving mysteries in our solar system, looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it.

It varies in intensity every six to eight weeks, making it one of the most active objects in the outer solar system. They discovered a new jet of carbon monoxide (CO) and previously unseen jets of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) gas, which give new clues to the nature of the centaur’s nucleus.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">“Centaurs can be considered as some of the leftovers of our planetary system’s formation. Because they are stored at very cold temperatures, they preserve information about volatiles in the early stages of the solar system,” said Sara Faggi of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and American University in Washington, DC, lead author of the study. “Webb really opened the door to a resolution and sensitivity that was impressive to us — when we saw the data for the first time, we were excited. We had never seen anything like this.”</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-top-5 margin-bottom-2\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreHeadingBlock\" id=\"h-webb-and-the-jets\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><h2><span><strong>Webb and the Jets</strong></span></h2><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">Centaurs’ distant orbits and consequent faintness have inhibited detailed observations in the past. Data from prior radio wavelength observations of Centaur 29P showed a jet pointed generally toward the Sun (and Earth) composed of CO. Webb detected this face-on jet and, thanks to its large mirror and infrared capabilities, also sensitively searched for many other chemicals, including water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and CO<sub>2</sub>. The latter is one of the main forms in which carbon is stored across the solar system. No indication of water vapor was detected in the atmosphere of 29P, which could be related to the extremely cold temperatures present in this body.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">The telescope’s unique imaging and spectral data revealed never-before-seen features: two jets of CO<sub>2</sub> emanating in the north and south directions, and another jet of CO pointing toward the north. This was the first definitive detection of CO<sub>2</sub> in Centaur 29P.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-top-5 margin-bottom-2\"><!--[--><!--[--><div id=\"h-image-b-ifu-graphic\" class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreHeadingBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><h2><span>Image B: IFU Graphic</span></h2><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-3\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreParagraphBlock\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><p class=\"margin-0 padding-0\">Based on the data gathered by Webb, the team created a 3D model of the jets to understand their orientation and origin. They found through their modeling efforts that the jets were emitted from different regions on the centaur’s nucleus, even though the nucleus itself cannot be resolved by Webb. The jets’ angles suggest the possibility that the nucleus may be an aggregate of distinct objects with different compositions; however, other scenarios can’t yet be excluded.</p><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-top-5 margin-bottom-2\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module width-full maxw-full CoreHeadingBlock\" id=\"h-video-a-zoom-and-spin\"><div class=\"grid-container-block grid-container padding-0\"><!--[--><h2><span>Video A: Zoom and Spin</span></h2><!--]--></div></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><div class=\"BlockLayout BlockLayoutPost entry-content margin-y-5 desktop:margin-y-6\"><!--[--><!--[--><div class=\"BlockWrapper hds-module CoreEmbedBlock hds-media margin-left-auto margin-right-auto\"><!--[--><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-providerNameSlug-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"flex-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SkDxFy3ri4M?feature=oembed\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" title=\"Centaur 29P Outgassing (Artist's Concept)\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper\"><figcaption class=\"hds-caption padding-top-2\"><div class=\"hds-caption-text p-sm margin-0\">An artist’s concept of Centaur 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1’s outgassing activity as seen from the side.

Do the jets always have that orientation? Is there perhaps another carbon monoxide jet that turns on at a different point in the rotation period?
